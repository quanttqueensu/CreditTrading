// WHY. Prod is this repository at a tag and nothing else (docs/ROADMAP.md
// phase 6). A tag is the only thing that reaches the order path, so the tag is
// where the checks sit. A green suite says little about the code that places
// orders (CLAUDE.md), so the diff that touches the order path is reviewed by two
// seats that did not write it.
//
// WHY ONE PINNED COMMIT. On 2026-10-10 a run was asked to check b3e4e9e in the
// send-headroom worktree, but this script never read its args. The checks ran
// in the worktree; both reviewers read HEAD of the main checkout, which sat on
// another branch. The decision agent noticed and said NO-GO, but only because
// it compared the two answers by eye. Now the checks stage resolves one full SHA
// and the last release tag, every later agent is handed both and reads code
// through git at that SHA, and the script itself refuses a review that does not
// say it covered that range.
