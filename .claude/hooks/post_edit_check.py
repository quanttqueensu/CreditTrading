"""PostToolUse(Edit|Write) check: the four bug classes this repo actually ships.

WHY THESE FOUR
--------------
Not a generic linter. Every pattern below is a real defect this codebase has
shipped to production, found later, and written up. The point of running them
on every edit is that all four are DORMANT faults -- they look fine, they pass
tests, and they surface months later inside a confident-looking number.

  A. SILENT FALLBACK. `nav_now = _nav_last(...) or 500000.0` sized every
     displayed target against an invented $500k book. `fee.fillna(fee.median())`
     charged an unmeasured name 0.83%/yr inside a total that looked measured.
     House rule: raise, naming what was missing.
     (docs/SYSTEM_AND_STRATEGY.md 9.1)

  B. EXECUTION CONVENTION. `validate.py:86` used `held = W.shift(1)` -- an
     entry at day t's close using day t's NAV, which publishes AFTER that
     close. Cost: gross SR 1.26 -> 0.95, net SR 0.82 -> 0.51. The convention is
     shift(2): decide at t, MOC fill at t+1, earn the t+2 return.
     A shift(1) on a ROLLING MOMENT (mu, sigma) is correct and expected; a
     shift(1) on HELD WEIGHTS is the lookahead bug. The check cannot tell them
     apart, so it names both readings and leaves the judgement to you.
     (results/AUDIT_2026-07-31.md)

  C. FROZEN SPEC EDITED. A spec key is a governance object, not a constant.
     A new key must default to current behaviour and the no-op must be PROVED
     by diffing sleeve output byte-for-byte with the key absent.

  D. SYNTAX. A file that does not compile, caught now rather than at 17:15 ET.

Advisory, never blocking: it reports on ADDED lines only (via git diff), so it
speaks about what you just wrote rather than about the file's history. Exit 0
always -- a broken checker must not break editing.
