"""SessionStart hook: open every session knowing what trades, and from where.

Prints a short plain-text block, which Claude Code shows to Claude on
SessionStart. Deliberately a few lines: this cost is paid on every session.

REWRITTEN 2026-09-28 for the Alpaca migration (the IBKR-era banner -- last
broker-confirmed fill, halts, heartbeats -- is at git tag `pre-clean-slate`),
and again 2026-10-08, because the 09-28 version printed "NO LIVE BOOK ...
Nothing trades" from a constant for nine days after the book armed
(`docs/ROADMAP.md` 4.8). It now prints `book_state.collect()`, which is
`ops.prod_state`: which machine is prod, whether it is armed, its tag, its last
verify verdict and the broker-confirmed equity, and a WARNING first if two
machines are armed for the one Alpaca account.

The principle from the IBKR banner stands, in both directions: say plainly
what is true, and when the reader fails, say UNMEASURED rather than print
nothing -- a missing line reads as "nothing to report", which is a claim.

The VM is read over ssh with a 3-second budget (`book_state.BANNER_VM_TIMEOUT_S`),
so an unreachable VM costs a session start at most that and reads UNMEASURED.
