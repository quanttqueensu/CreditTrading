"""Do this repo's documents still say true things? Measured, not asserted.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
CLAUDE.md carries a section called "Documents that will mislead you". On
2026-09-13 that section was audited against the filesystem and **every specific
defect it named had already been fixed**:

    "INFRASTRUCTURE.md:171 still names spec v5.20260731"   -> says v6.20260906
    "PLAN.md :154 and :174 are still unmarked"             -> all 5 rows marked
    "PER_NAME_ARCHITECTURE.md:150 still carries the pooled 24.6"
                                                           -> flagged in place
    "SYSTEM_AND_STRATEGY.md has NO banner"                 -> banner at line 11

That section warns, in its own words, that "a table that asserts the remedy is
MISSING when it is not is the same defect wearing the opposite sign, and costs a
re-fix". It had become the thing it warns about -- the most elaborate warning in
the repo, and the stalest object in it.

Hand-maintained claims about files rot because the files move and the claims do
not. So the claims move here, where they are CHECKED rather than asserted, and
CLAUDE.md keeps the rule and drops the counts. This is the same trade
`ops/orient.py` made for the hygiene greps and `ops/session_uptime.py` made for
the arm rate, both for the same reason.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
It cannot tell you whether a document's ARGUMENT is sound, only whether the
specific, mechanically checkable things it says still match the repo. A PASS
here is not a statement that a document is trustworthy. Read the banner.
