"""`ops.orient` replaces remembered numbers with measured ones. So it must not
invent one, and it must not die trying.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
An orientation tool has a failure mode worse than being absent: being confidently
wrong. It is the first thing a new agent runs, its output looks authoritative,
and every number in it is about to be quoted. The two properties that matter are
therefore not "does it produce a number" but:

  1. when it CANNOT measure something, it says so by name and produces no value
     (the repo's NO SILENT FALLBACKS rule, applied to a report rather than a
     calculation);
  2. one broken section does not take the other eight down with it.

The `ib_insync` check gets the most tests because it is the one whose prescribed
recipe was provably unable to express the property it checked. `CLAUDE.md` says
to run

    grep -rn '^ *from ib_insync' ops/ src/ scripts/ | grep -v ImportError

and asserts the answer is zero. On 2026-09-11 that grep returned 5 and the true
answer was 2 — the `except ImportError:` that makes an import safe is on a
different LINE from the import, so the filter filters nothing. Three imports are
correctly guarded and two are not. `.claude/rules/live-order-path.md` says "Two
legacy scripts still import it; do not add a third", which is the reading this
check must reproduce.

NO NETWORK, NO BROKER, NO PROD TREE. The classifier tests build Python source in
`tmp_path`; the degradation tests point the module's constants at paths that do
not exist.
