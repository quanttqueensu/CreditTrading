"""Which machine is prod, and is it armed? Measured on every call, never written.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
On 2026-09-28 IBKR was retired and three surfaces were rewritten to say so:
`ops.orient` printed "prod none ... the Alpaca prod (cloud VM) is not built"
and "live book NONE -- nothing trades", the SessionStart banner "NO LIVE BOOK
... Nothing trades", and the status line "no live book" in red. Each was a
string constant. The first armed session was 2026-09-29 (the laptop's
`~/quantt_state/cef/verify.log`) and the book has traded since, while all three
went on saying it did not, because a constant cannot notice that it has become
false. That is the failure the IBKR-era reader existed to prevent (a 21-session
outage under surfaces that read "ok") with the sign reversed.

The answer to "which machine is prod" is also about to move: prod goes from the
laptop (launchd) to an Azure VM (systemd) by `docs/RUNBOOK.md` section 8. A
written answer would be wrong within the week. So this module measures, and
orient, the banner and the status line all read it (`docs/ROADMAP.md` 4.8).

WHAT "ARMED" MEANS HERE (`docs/RUNNER.md`, gates 1 and 2)
--------------------------------------------------------
  ARMED          the scheduler will fire the session job, DRY_RUN is exactly
                 "0" in its environment, AND `<state>/AUTO_ARMED` exists: every
                 decided plan is sent.
  PER_DAY        as ARMED but with no AUTO_ARMED: a scheduled send transmits
                 only a plan that carries a recorded per-day approval.
  DRY            the scheduler fires it, and DRY_RUN is anything but "0" (unset
                 included): gate 1 sends nothing.
  OFF            installed, but the scheduler will not fire the session job:
                 launchd has it unloaded AND disabled, or systemd has its timer
                 inactive AND not enabled. What its files say is kept, and a
                 DRY_RUN=0 or an AUTO_ARMED left behind is raised as a caution.
  NOT_INSTALLED  that machine has no session job.
  UNMEASURED     a reading the call needs failed; the reason is kept.

The scheduler's environment is read where the scheduler reads it: the laptop's
plist `EnvironmentVariables`, and systemd's LOADED `Environment` on the VM, not
the unit file (`quantt/deploy/install_vm.py` records why the loaded copy is the
truth). "Will fire" is not "is loaded right now": `docs/RUNBOOK.md` 8.5 step 1
records that launchd loads a plist in `~/Library/LaunchAgents` again at the
next login, so an unloaded job that is NOT disabled still counts as scheduled,
and a stopped timer that is still enabled starts again at boot. Only unloaded
and disabled (or inactive and not enabled) is OFF.

MEASURED 2026-10-08, mid cut-over: the laptop's three jobs were unloaded and
disabled with AUTO_ARMED removed, but its plists still said DRY_RUN=0 (8.5
step 1a not yet run). A first version of this module read "DRY_RUN=0 in the
plist" as armed and printed the two-schedulers WARNING over a scheduler that
could not fire. That false alarm is why OFF exists, and why the plists'
DRY_RUN=0 is still reported (as a caution, not a hazard).

TWO ARMED SCHEDULERS ON ONE ACCOUNT
-----------------------------------
Both machines trade one Alpaca paper account. Each checks gate 6 against its
own state dir, so two schedulers with DRY_RUN=0 would each send, and only the
Alpaca-side `client_order_id` prefix check would stand between them and a
doubled book (`CLAUDE.md` order-path rule 2). `verdict()` raises a WARNING
whenever both machines are ARMED or PER_DAY. A machine that cannot be measured
is never assumed safe: one armed machine beside an UNMEASURED one is reported
as "a second armed scheduler is not ruled out".

READ-ONLY, AND WHAT IT NEVER TOUCHES
------------------------------------
On the laptop: `launchctl list` and `launchctl print-disabled` (read-only verbs;
the only ones the test harness lets through), `git describe`, and file reads.
On the VM: one `ssh` call that runs `REMOTE_SCRIPT`, a fixed read-only script.
It never reads `QUANTT_ENV_FILE` or `config/.env`, never reads `/run/quantt`
(the keys), and cuts systemd's Environment down to DRY_RUN on the VM so not
even the key file's path crosses the wire. It never touches `~/prod/QUANTT`,
the retired IBKR tree, which is not the Alpaca prod.

THE DAILY P&L SERIES (added 2026-10-19)
--------------------------------------
The team lead ruled on 2026-10-19 that Alpaca's end-of-day portfolio history
(GET /v2/account/portfolio/history, timeframe=1D) is the official daily P&L of
record, and that verify's `equity - last_equity`, read after the close, is a
labelled snapshot beside it. On the four sessions the main session compared
that day, the snapshot differed from the EOD history on every one and the
auction-marked score agreed with it far more closely [V, main session
2026-10-19; the account's figures are kept out of this public repo]: the
snapshot is marked after the close (`quantt/session/score.py` (a) flags it
[U]). So each machine's reading now carries its P&L files
(`PNL_FILES`): the EOD series whole, and the last rows of the snapshot,
auction-marked and distribution-adjusted scores. Only the named columns cross
the wire, selected by header ON the VM (`pnl_tails`); scores.csv's
`per_symbol_json`, which holds the positions, never does. orient's PNL section
does the arithmetic, from the prod machine's files only.

THE REPO IS PUBLIC
------------------
The VM is reached only by the ssh alias `quantt-vm`. Its address lives in
`~/.ssh/config` and nowhere in this repository. ssh's own errors name the
address ("connect to host <ip> port 22"), and readouts get pasted into tracked
notes, so stderr is scrubbed of IP addresses before it is returned.

STDLIB ONLY
-----------
The SessionStart hook and the status line import this on every session, so it
imports only the standard library, the NYSE calendar, and the two installers,
which are stdlib-only themselves and are the single owners of the labels, unit
names and paths read here. A path written twice drifts; one imported does not.

    WHY BY HEADER, AND ON THE VM. scores.csv carries per_symbol_json, which

    this module's rule is that positions never leave the VM. The wanted columns
    are found in the header and only those cells are copied, so no other cell
    of any row is ever put in the reply; a renamed or reordered file is a named
    error, not a value read from the wrong column.

    WHY IT IS WRITTEN LIKE THIS. Its source is sent to the VM as text
    (_PNL_PY) and run there by python3 -I, and the laptop calls it in-process,
    so both machines are read by one code path. Hence: stdlib only, imports
    inside, no annotations, and no double quote, dollar sign, backtick or
    backslash anywhere in it (it sits in a double-quoted shell word; an assert
    below _PNL_PY enforces that).

    files maps key -> (file name, wanted columns, rows kept from the end).
    Per key the result is exactly one of
        {'rows': [[...], ...], 'n_rows': data rows in the file, 'file': name}
        {'absent': name}       the file does not exist
