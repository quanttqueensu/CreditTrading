"""Durable halt records and the alerting that makes a halt impossible to miss.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
On 2026-07-31 two separate faults produced total silence:

  1. 09:35 — the launchd job died with exit 126 (`getcwd: Operation not
     permitted`, a TCC/Full-Disk-Access fault). It wrote two lines to a log and
     transmitted nothing.
  2. 16:33 — the CEF job DID trade, then the shadow ledger KeyErrored on a
     missing cost entry. The exception was caught and printed as one `repr()`
     line inside an otherwise successful-looking run that ended with "ok".

In both cases the operator learned nothing until a human went reading logs. For
a book that is supposed to run unattended, "the failure is in a log file" is the
same as no failure handling at all — logs are pull, and an unattended system
needs push.

So a halt here is three things at once, in increasing order of loudness:

  * `ops/HALT.md`   — durable, greppable, and read by `ops/preflight.py` as a
                      HARD GATE. This is the one that actually stops the money:
                      it survives reboots and outlives any notification.
  * macOS banner + spoken alert — reaches the operator if they are at the machine.
  * email           — reaches them if they are not.

The ordering matters. Alerting is best-effort and must NEVER be able to mask the
fault it is reporting, so every notification path is individually wrapped: an
SMTP timeout cannot prevent HALT.md from being written, and a failed banner
cannot swallow the traceback. The file write happens FIRST and unguarded.

    WHY SCOPED HALTS EXIST (2026-09-10). `ops/HALT.md` blocks every book, which
    is right for a fault nobody can explain and wrong for a fault that belongs
    to one book. Three halts in three days proved it:

      * 09-09 09:37  phase0 could not attribute JNK  -> blocked the CEF book
      * 09-09 17:25  bench_b6 could not attribute ANGL (its own $2.5k fill,
                     placed before its ledger was re-seeded) -> would have
                     blocked the CEF session at 22:45
      * both cleared by hand, both about a book that is not the strategy

    A $20,000 benchmark book must not be able to stop a $500,000 strategy over
    its own bookkeeping. `arm()` only ever refuses on symbols the book being
    armed trades, so an arming failure is inherently that book's problem.

    The scope is a DOWNGRADE for other books, never a dismissal: preflight
    reports another book's scoped halt as a non-blocking WARNING naming the
    book, so the operator still sees it on every session. A human halt, and
    anything whose cause is not provably one book's, stays global.

    Same directory and prefix as `HALT.md` on purpose: `ls ops/HALT*.md` shows
    everything that is currently blocking anything.
