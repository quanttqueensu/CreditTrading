"""Credit closed-end fund discount reversion.

THE TRADE, IN ONE PARAGRAPH. A closed-end fund publishes what its portfolio is
worth (net asset value) every day, and its shares trade at whatever the market
pays. Unlike an ETF, a CEF's share count is FIXED -- there are no authorised
participants who can create or redeem shares against the basket, so nothing
mechanically drags the price back to NAV. Credit CEFs therefore sit at discounts
averaging -3.2% with a standard deviation near 6%, against roughly 0.04% for an
ETF. Those discounts wander and come back. We buy the funds trading unusually
cheap against their OWN history and sell the ones trading unusually rich, in
equal dollars, so a market-wide move in credit cancels out.

WHY AGAINST THEIR OWN HISTORY AND NOT EACH OTHER. A leveraged municipal CEF
structurally trades wider than a multi-sector one -- different fee, different
buyer, different leverage. Ranking on the raw discount would just be a permanent
long-muni/short-multisector bet dressed up as a signal. Ranking each fund against
its own normal level removes that and leaves the dislocation.

RISK SIZING IS VOLATILITY-TARGETED, and this is a measured decision, not a
default. Sorted by how dislocated the market is, this strategy's net Sharpe runs
1.24 / 0.59 / 0.80 / -0.23 / 0.68 from calm to stressed: it is BEST in calm
markets, because in stress the returns get bigger but the volatility grows faster.
A constant-notional book therefore takes its worst losses exactly when each unit
of risk pays least -- that is what produced a -31.5% drawdown at 35.8% volatility
in 2008. Scaling to constant risk on trailing realised volatility cut the
full-sample drawdown from -27% to -12%.

STALE NAV IS THE ONE THING THAT SILENTLY BREAKS THIS. The whole signal is
price-minus-NAV, so a fund whose NAV has not updated is not a cheap fund, it is a
blind one. Any fund whose NAV is older than `max_nav_age_bd` business days is
dropped for the day rather than traded. A NAV can also be stale and freshly
dated: Yahoo serves a row dated D carrying D-1's NAV
(results/cef/LIVE_NAV_QUALITY_2026-10-12.md §5). The runner's stale-NAV gate
(`quantt/session/nav_gate.py`) names the funds it could not verify by its final
pre-send check in `extras["nav_hold"]`: each keeps its current shares and leaves
the cross-section (`_nav_hold`). Absent, nothing changes.

TWO CONSTRAINTS SIT ON TOP OF THE SIGNAL, and both are OFF unless the frozen spec
turns them on. Neither is a return idea; each removes a way this book has been
measured to go wrong.

  `group_cap`         The cross-sectional demeaning above removes the market,
                      not the MANDATE. Measured on the live book at 2026-09-11,
                      92.5%-style concentration had become literal: the
                      rolling-252 R^2 of the book's own P&L to the in-panel
                      muni-minus-taxable spread was 0.746 (beta -0.62, NW
                      t -11.8) and effective breadth had fallen to 2.27 bets on
                      a nominal 17 names. `group_cap` bounds |sum(muni w) -
                      sum(taxable w)|. It buys risk and breadth, not return --
                      the paired return difference is statistically zero on
                      every window measured. `ng/05_research_group_neutrality.md`
                      (GN-N2, CEF trial 55).

  `max_gross_stress`  The vol scalar targets 6% of volatility; nothing targets
                      MARGIN, and margin is what this account is actually short
                      of. At the 2026-09-15 16:50 ET account read the fundable
                      gross under a worst-week buffer was 1.931x the $500k book,
                      and the book as it runs exceeds that on 17.0% of traded
                      days with nothing on the live path stopping it.
                      `max_gross_stress` scales the held book down -- never up,
                      never flat -- until it fits.
                      `ng/05_research_no_borrow_rescore.md` §6.2, §8.2.

FOUR MORE OPTIONAL KEYS LET A SECOND SPEC REUSE THIS SLEEVE (C4 deployment
plan, results/cef/C4_DEPLOY_PLAN_2026-10-27.md §1 row 1, added 2026-10-27).
Trial C4 (results/cef/PREREG_C4_FAMILIES_2026-10-13.md) ran this z-score on 74
other funds through `band_frontier.build_targets(universe=, source=, mask=)`.
Rather than copy the signal into a C4 module, the C4 spec will name:

  `panel_source`      which price and NAV parquet the sleeve reads
                      (`panel_paths`). Absent: `data/cef/`, as today.
  `nav_repeat_mask`   M1: a fund-day whose NAV equals its previous NAV row
                      exactly has no discount (`_discount_masks`).
  `zero_volume_mask`  M2: a fund-day with zero volume has no discount.
  `below_min_names`   "flatten" (absent; today's rule) or "hold" (the
                      trial's): what the book does when fewer than
                      `min_names` funds are eligible.

ALL FOUR ABSENT IS TODAY'S BOOK, BYTE FOR BYTE: the 13's plan.json, orders and
plan_sha were pinned from the code before the keys existed
(`quantt/session/tests/test_c4_keys_noop.py`), and the sleeve's targets were
diffed before and after on 1,758 real-panel date-books (the commit message).
Each key is parsed once, in `src/deploy/registry.py`, and a malformed value
raises naming it.

def _cap_net_group_weight(w: pd.Series, side: dict, k: float) -> tuple[pd.Series, bool]:
    """Shrink |net muni-minus-taxable weight| to at most `k`, dollar-neutrally.

    THE OPERATOR, AND WHY IT IS THIS ONE. `g = sum(w over muni) - sum(w over
    taxable)`. Shift every HELD muni weight by `-d_m` and every HELD taxable
    weight by `+d_t`. Dollar neutrality (the row's signed sum must not move)
    forces `n_m*d_m == n_t*d_t`; the cap forces `g - 2*n_m*d_m == sign(g)*k`.
    With `D = |g| - k > 0` that gives::

        d_m = sign(g)*D/(2*n_m)     d_t = sign(g)*D/(2*n_t)

    Rows already inside the cap are returned UNTOUCHED, which is what makes this
    a cap and not a tilt. The shift is uniform within a group because any other
    allocation needs a second parameter (a per-name penalty), and this change is
    allowed one.

    THIS IS NOT A PROPORTIONAL RESCALING OF THE OFFENDING SIDE, and the
    difference is the whole point: a rescaling shrinks the names that carry the
    tilt AND the names that oppose it, so it throws away name selection to buy
    group neutrality. The uniform shift only moves the group's centre. It also
    never drops a name -- a name whose weight crosses zero keeps trading, it
    simply changes side, which is the signal's own instruction once the group
    bet is removed.

    `n_m` / `n_t` count names HELD IN THIS ROW (non-zero weight), not the 6/11
    nominal group sizes: shifting a name the book does not hold would open a
    position the signal never asked for.

    NO SILENT FALLBACK. If the row breaches the cap while one entire side is
    unheld, no dollar-neutral uniform shift exists -- there is nothing to shift
    it against. Raise, rather than leave the row uncapped wearing a capped
    label.

    THE SAME OPERATOR GN-N2 WAS SCORED WITH, and the agreement is measured
    rather than claimed (`ng/store/deploy/gc_score.py` pins 3a/3b/3c, run over
    the full panel before it will print a table):

      * against a ROW-WISE transcription of `gn_common.soft_cap`'s algebra,
        max abs difference **exactly 0.0** -- same arithmetic, same order;
      * against `gn_common.soft_cap` VECTORISED over the frame -- the call
        `gn_score.py` actually made -- **5.551e-17** on 1,608 of 92,769 cells.
        That residual is numpy's summation order, not semantics: `g` is a sum
        of 6 and of 11 floats, and reducing a (17 x 5457) block along axis 1
        orders the additions differently from a 17-element row. Control: the
        identical pandas expression on `build_targets()`'s C-contiguous frame
        and on `T.copy()`'s F-contiguous one disagrees by 4.441e-16.
      * no reported statistic moves (gross SR, annual return, vol, turnover all
        agree to exactly 0.0), and the resulting book reproduces GN-N2's
        published traded row.

    See `ng/08_strategy_change.md` §3 and `src/deploy/tests/test_group_cap.py`.

def _nav_hold(market_state, last: pd.Timestamp, universe) -> dict:
    """{ticker: reason}: names whose NAV the runner's stale-NAV gate could not verify.

    WHY. Yahoo serves a NAV row dated D that still carries an older NAV and
    corrects it later; on the laptop's paper sessions 28 of 73 checkable
    name-days were decided on such a row and 11 submitted orders were sized on
    one (results/cef/LIVE_NAV_QUALITY_2026-10-12.md §5). The runner checks each
    suspect NAV against CEFConnect (`quantt/session/nav_gate.py`). A name still
    unverified at its final pre-send check is HELD (team lead 2026-10-13): it
    keeps its current shares -- no order in it -- and leaves the cross-section,
    so its unverified z moves no other name's weight.

    WHY HOLD AND NOT DROP. The first version dropped such a name (target zero,
    then the band). Replayed on the laptop's sessions, that would have cut held
    positions to the band edge on the strength of a missing CEFConnect row, and
    on 2026-10-05 left 4 eligible names, under `min_names`, where the rule
    below emits every name FLAT and decide closes the whole book. So a held
    name is never targeted to zero, and holds never trigger that flatten
    (`target_positions`, the `min_names` block): when the cross-section is short
    of `min_names` only because of holds, the whole book holds for the day.

    Held names stay out of the sleeve's band and gross cap: their shares are
    fixed, so nothing here may scale them. Their gross is judged with the rest
    of the book by gate 8 and the send-time fit (`quantt/session/run.py`).

    A SECOND SOURCE OF HOLDS (2026-10-29, dark): the runner's missing-NAV hold
    (book json `data.missing_nav`, `quantt/session/gate.py` `missing_nav_hold`)
    passes, through this same extra, a name with no NAV dated the decision
    date, from the final check. Same contract; such a name has no paired row
    on the date, so it is counted toward `min_names` as possibly eligible
    (`target_positions`, the loop that builds the cross-section).

    `extras["nav_hold"] = {"asof": <date>, "names": {ticker: reason}}`. ABSENT
    is today's behaviour, byte for byte: proved against the sleeve before this
    change on 56 real panel dates, flat and held books (2026-10-13, the commit
    message), and kept by `src/deploy/tests/test_nav_hold.py`. Present, it must
    be well formed, name only universe tickers, and carry the date the sleeve
    decides on: a gate run for another day than the signal date is a runner
    bug, and holding on it would act on a NAV the gate never looked at. Each

        fitted to returns would be fitted to the very thing the cap exists to
        neutralise, and the neutrality would be circular.

        KNOWN CAVEAT, carried from the research and not re-derived here: `grp`
        is the CURRENT mandate applied over all history. Two of the 17 have
        recorded CRSP mandate changes (AWF 2007-01-29, PFN 2010-03-01) and
        NEITHER crosses the muni/taxable line, so the binary split is
        unaffected. A five-group split would not be.

        The axis is muni vs NOT-muni: the panel's `grp` takes the values
        muni / hy / loan / multi, and everything that is not `muni` is taxable.

        NO SILENT FALLBACK, three ways. A missing column, a ticker with two
        different `grp` values, or a universe name with no `grp` row all raise
        naming what is missing. A defaulted mandate would put a name on the
        wrong side of the very constraint being applied, and nothing downstream
        would notice.

        WITH `panel_source` SET the axis is read from THAT spec's price file,
        for the reason above: one path, the one the prices come from. Reading
        the core's `data/cef/` for another universe would raise on every name
        (no `grp` row), or worse, find a stale row for a ticker both panels

        of them). Its price, return, volume and ADV are untouched -- a masked
        day still trades and still earns -- and so is its NAV, so the
        `max_nav_age_bd` check reads the same NAV dates as before.

              are NOT stale copies, and the trial accepted that cost in breadth
              (4.1-8.4% of eligible fund-days per era, §4.3) for a rule that
              needs no second source and acts the same in every year.
          M2, `zero_volume_mask`: volume exactly 0 on a paired fund-day. The
              trial measured none among eligible fund-days over 2005-2026; it

        which is why execution is shift(2). The NAV rows are cut at `asof`
        BEFORE the repeat is computed, so no later row can reach the flag; for
        every row at or before `asof` the flag equals the trial's, which
        computed it on the whole file (a diff only looks back). The check below

        # vol scalar, after the min-weight re-neutralisation -- and BEFORE the
        # band. Two reasons, both load-bearing:
        #
        #  (1) k is DEFINED on the final target. The 0.30 was derived as the
        #      median |net group weight| the live book ran on its own targets
        #      over the traded era before 2023 (0.304953), which is the same
        #      object whose net group weight 05_verify measured at -1.24 over
        #      the last 12 months. Capping an intermediate vector would cap a
        #      different quantity wearing the same name.
        #  (2) It reproduces the scored construction. The research applied
        #      `soft_cap` to the target frame and then `band(.)`; anything else
        #      is not the thing that was measured.
        #
        # The cap is deliberately NOT followed by a re-normalisation: that would
        # undo it. The small change in gross is a consequence, is reported
        # rather than hidden, and is in the direction that helps (mean traded
        # gross 1.44x -> 1.23x).
        #
        # ADOPTION, NOT A NEW SEARCH. CEF trial 55 (GN-N2) is already spent on
        # this operator and this k. What is claimed is risk and breadth, not
        # return: the paired return difference is statistically zero on every
        # window, including -1.13 %/yr (t -1.67) on the only window that is out
        # of sample for k. See results/cef/PREREG_GROUP_CAP_2026-09-16.md.

        # ---- NO-TRADE BAND ---------------------------------------------------
        # Applied HERE and not earlier: the min-weight block above re-neutralises
        # and re-normalises to unit gross, which would silently undo the band.
        #
        # Policy (Constantinides 1986; Davis & Norman 1990): hold unless a name
        # is more than `band_width` from target, then trade back to the BAND
        # EDGE, not to target. Measured over 5,452 sessions the band dominates
        # the rebalance calendar at every width tested AND at matched turnover
        # -- net Sharpe 0.33 -> 0.66 at 15bp on 43% less trading -- because a
        # calendar's information loss compounds with its interval while a band
        # only ever discards small moves. See docs/PLAN.md Part 2.
        #
        # THE COMPARISON IS AGAINST WHAT WE ACTUALLY HOLD, not against a stored
        # previous target. That is the deliberate difference from the backtest,
        # which has no failed fills. It makes the policy self-correcting: if a
        # session does not arm, or an order does not fill, the real position
        # simply sits further from target and the band closes it on a later day
        # rather than the sleeve believing in a book it never got.
        #
        # ---- OPENING SESSION: FULL TARGET, BAND SKIPPED ----------------------
        # Decision (team lead, 2026-09-28, docs/RUNNER.md "Day one (flat
        # book)"): the FIRST session of a book trades to FULL TARGET, not to the
        # band edge; the band applies from the second session on.
        #
        # WHY. From a flat book the band trades every name only to its EDGE,
        # i.e. target minus `band_width` toward zero, and names whose target is
        # inside the band not at all. The edge-shrink is not symmetric across
        # the long and short sides, so the opening book is NOT dollar-neutral:
        # measured on the last three panel dates at the time of the decision,
        # net -0.05 to -0.10 of NAV (docs/RUNNER.md 4.2; v6 on 17 names did the
        # same). A dollar-neutral book that opens 5-10% net short carries
        # exactly the credit beta it exists to avoid, and only drifts back as
        # the band happens to trade. Trading to target once removes that.
        #
        # WHERE. The switch replaces ONLY the band: every name goes to its full
        # target `w` as it stands here -- after normalisation, the vol scalar,
        # the min-weight re-neutralisation and the group cap -- and the gross /
        # margin cap below STILL applies, because margin is charged on the
        # opening book like any other.
        #
        # WHO SAYS IT IS THE OPENING SESSION. The runner, through
        # `MarketState.extras["opening_session"]`. The sleeve does not infer it
        # from empty holdings: a flat book is also what a failed day, a
        # manual flatten or a broker read that came back empty looks like, and
        # silently re-targeting in those cases would move the policy on a
        # guess. Conversely a runner that sets the flag against a LIVE book has
        # a bug -- full-target trading of a held book discards the band's
        # entire cost saving and churns every name -- so that RAISES rather
        # than trades.
