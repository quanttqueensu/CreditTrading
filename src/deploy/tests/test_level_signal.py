"""`level_signal` (CEF trial 54): absent is C4's v4 book byte for byte; present is §1.2 exactly.

results/cef/PREREG_C4_LEVEL_2026-11-02.md §1, approved by the team lead 2026-11-03. With the key
set, C4's UNIT target is an equal-risk blend of its z target and a within-family discount-level
target, through the same vol scalar, multiplier, band and 1.90 gross cap
(src/deploy/sleeves/cef_discount.py, module docstring; `_level_weights`, `_blend_unit_book`).

THE NO-OP (§1.3 test 1), against the code BEFORE the key, f7f7be5 (origin/main when this branch
was cut; C4's spec there is c4_families.v4.20261102), and against 4485a96 (origin/main when it was
merged in, 2026-11-03; the same sleeve and spec, a newer runner):
  1. `test_key_absent_targets_are_f7f7be5s` NEVER SKIPS. The sleeve on a generated 74-fund C4
     panel, on C4's live spec with `level_signal` and its note removed (asserted to leave v4's
     frozen block, byte for byte), on a flat book and a held book at three dates. Every target's
     fingerprint (repr floats, reasons, meta) is hashed, in full and with floats to 10 significant
     digits, and compared with hashes computed by f7f7be5's code (and by 4485a96's: identical).
  2. `test_key_absent_session_is_f7f7be5s`: a full C4 session through `run_session` on that
     panel with C4's v4 spec (the live file while it is v4, else `git show f7f7be5:...`, so the
     proof survives the activation): plan.json, plan_sha, orders, targets and the run record of
     the evening decide, and the run record of the 15:52 send, against 4485a96's runner. Skips,
     warning, only when neither source gives v4's bytes.
  ON OTHER CPUs (`_check_pins`, test_combine_noop's rule). The pins were made on an arm64 Mac. CI's
  x86 moves the last ulp of the repr fingerprints, plan.json and the run records (seen on the CI run
  of 3b4c963), so those are exact on the pin machine only and a warning elsewhere; every other entry
  (the rounded fingerprints, orders, plan_sha, plan targets, counts, exits) must match everywhere.
  HOW THE PINS WERE MADE: `git archive <commit>` into a scratch directory, this file copied into
  that tree, `print_pins()` run there unseeded and under PYTHONHASHSEED 1 and 2 (identical every
  time); then on this tree (identical again). Never edit a hash by hand. Both pass on the old code by
  construction: they are no-op proofs. The real-panel proof (the last 10 dates of the core's and
  C4's panels, both specs) is in the commit messages.

WHAT THE KEY DOES. Each test below fails on f7f7be5 (shown before it was kept; the commit
message says how each fails):
  3. the blend is §1.2's construction, against an independent numpy re-derivation from the
     sleeve's own eligible names, discount and prices (to 1e-12), with C4's masks and ADV floor
     applied to the level as to the z;
  4. a family with one ELIGIBLE name contributes zero level weight (a singleton family, and a
     pair whose other member is illiquid: the family mean is over eligible names only);
  5. a ticker missing from family_of raises, naming it: at load, at construction, and in
     `_level_weights` for an eligible name;
  6. the blend reads nothing after t: every row after t perturbed leaves t's targets
     byte-identical, and the alignment check refuses returns past the signal date;
  7. the risk_share -> 1 limit (reachable only through a test patch: the key refuses 1.0) is
     the z book;
  8. the cap still binds at max_gross_stress / m in unit weights, so the emitted gross is at
     most max_gross_stress x NAV (both read from C4's spec, never written here);
  9. equal risk: at risk_share 0.5 the two parts' standalone vols and Euler risk contributions
     are equal to 1e-12, on returns with known vols;
 10. the registry refuses every malformed value, a near-miss spelling and the key without a band.

Synthetic data throughout: every conclusion is about this code, never about a market.
