"""CEF trial 55 (te4): K3's run length in the spec agrees with the compose run its thresholds cite.

WHY (the runner owner's round-2 answer (c), 2026-11-05). K3 trips on `risk.thin_k3_run_sessions`
reduced closes in sequence above `risk.thin_k3_net_run` (pre-registration §6.3: 3). The spec is
the only authority on that count (registry `cef_thin_stop_levels`, required under the rule since
the owner's review of 2026-11-04, item 9), and the thresholds are re-measured on the read date by
`results/cef/prereg_thin_te4/compose.py`, which counted the fit's runs with a literal 3 until this
answer. A spec could then say one run length while the compose run its notes cite measured the
rule at another, and nothing would say so. compose.py now takes the count as the REQUIRED argument
`--k3-run-sessions` and records it in compose_<stamp>.json as `k3_run_sessions`.

WHY A TEST, NOT A REGISTRY CHECK. The owner asked that "the registry refuses a spec whose
risk.thin_k3_run_sessions differs from the run length recorded in the compose file its threshold
notes cite". The owner also ruled (answer 3, round 1, 2026-11-03) that "the live path never reads
results/", and `src/deploy/registry.py` validates on the live path: the sleeve's constructor and
run.py call it on every session. So the guard is this test. CI runs it on every push
(.github/workflows/checks.yml), and prod installs only a release-checked tag (`/release-check`
runs the suite), so a spec and a compose file that disagree cannot reach a release together. The
owner can overrule this and move it into the registry; docs/RUNNER.md says the same.

`k3_run_drift(spec, compose_dir)` is the guard. For a spec that sets `risk.thin_k3_run_sessions`
it reads every `compose_<stamp>.json` named in a te4 note (the four K-line thresholds' notes, and
the run length's own note if it names one) and returns a problem, naming the note and the file,
for a cited file that is missing, unreadable, records no `k3_run_sessions` (every compose file
written before 2026-11-05) or records another count; and for a K-line threshold whose note names
no compose file (the registry already refuses that; the guard does not rely on it). A spec without
the key has nothing to agree with: [].

The AST test of compose.py fails on the commit before compose.py took --k3-run-sessions (01c7d79:
no such argument, and `runs_above` called with the literals 3 and 2). The committed-spec test is
a PIN today: no committed spec sets the key yet (te4 is dark), so it passes on the old code as
well; it bites from the activation commit. The guard's own logic is tested on synthetic specs and
compose files in tmp_path.
