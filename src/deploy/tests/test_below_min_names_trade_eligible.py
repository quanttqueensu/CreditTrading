"""`below_min_names = "trade_eligible"` on the core sleeve (CEF trial 55, te4, PAPER ONLY).

THE RULE (results/cef/PREREG_THIN_TRADE_ELIGIBLE_2026-11-03.md §1.1-§1.3, approved by the team
lead 2026-11-03 with every recommended answer in §10). On a session with fewer than `min_names`
eligible names but at least `below_min_names_floor`, and no NAV holds, the sleeve builds the book
on the eligible names with its own construction instead of going FLAT. The harness version, which
the live build must equal, is `band_frontier.band_gross_capped(below_min_names="trade_eligible",
floor=)` on `build_targets(min_names=floor)`.

WHAT EACH GROUP WOULD CATCH:

  1. THE PAPER-ONLY REFUSAL (§1.2, Q14). `account` is None or exactly "paper" at construction,
     whatever the spec says; under the key every decide raises, naming it, without the paper
     declaration or without a well-formed `extras["thin_rule"]` -- on a full session too. With
     the key absent neither is read.
  2. THE REDUCED BUILD. 5 and 4 eligible build on the set: the unit target equals the harness's
     `_target_row` then `_cap_gross` (flat book, opening session) and the band's one step from a
     held book; 3 eligible (below the floor) goes FLAT, as today.
  3. WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CHANGED. Any hold leaves the build off, the tag in place, reduced
     False (Q10). The min-weight guard stays at `min_names` (Q12): a 4-name set with one name
     under `min_abs_weight` is not re-neutralised and that name is FLAT. On a session with at
     least `min_names` eligible the targets are the key-absent targets apart from
     `meta["cef_thin"]`.
  4. THE NEW REFUSAL AND THE STOPS. 0/0 (every eligible z equal) raises on the reduced path and
     only there. A stop (K0 or gate 7) sends a session that would have built the reduced book to
     the flatten path and records `stopped_by`; nowhere else does it record anything.
  5. THE CALLERS THAT BUILD WITHOUT DECIDING. With the key set, the sleeve is still constructed
     the way `quantt/session/run.py::spec_panel` (`CEFDiscountSleeve(spec, 0.0).panel_paths()`),
     `ops/common.py::deployed_tickers` and `quantt/session/combine.py::load_sleeves` build it
     every session (the owner's requirement). run.py is not imported here: it holds the code that
     sends orders; its one line is reproduced.
  6. THE HARNESS ON THE REAL PANEL. Every reduced fit date (floor <= n < min_names eligible,
     before 2023-01-01): the sleeve's unit target equals `_cap_gross(_target_row(...))` with
     `opening_session` True, and the sleeve's band step from the harness's own previous held book
     equals the harness's next row, at 1e-12, except names under `min_abs_weight` (the dust
     filter, a declared divergence, §8 item 1). Skipped, saying why, when `data/` lacks the panel.

Synthetic panels for groups 1-5 (`test_group_cap._write_panel`, 12 funds): the conclusions are
about this code, never about a market.

FAILS ON ac15d09 (the code before te4): there the sleeve's constructor takes no `account`, the
registry refuses "trade_eligible", and nothing builds a reduced book; every test here fails or
errors on it except the real-panel group when `data/` is absent (it skips).
