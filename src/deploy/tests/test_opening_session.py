"""`MarketState.extras["opening_session"]`: day one trades to FULL target.

THE DECISION (team lead, 2026-09-28, docs/RUNNER.md "Day one (flat book)"): the
first session of a book trades to full target, not to the band edge, so the book
opens dollar-neutral; the band applies from the second session. From a flat book
the band trades each name only to its EDGE, and that opening book came out net
-0.05 to -0.10 of NAV on the last three panel dates (docs/RUNNER.md 4.2).

WHAT EACH TEST WOULD HAVE CAUGHT:

  1. THE NO-OP. The flag is a new input on the live path, and the house rule is
     that absent must be today's behaviour, PROVED byte-for-byte. Checked on the
     REAL panels (`data/cef/`, the live frozen spec, the last three panel dates)
     for a flat book AND a held book -- the held book takes the band's HOLD
     branch, which a flat book never reaches -- and again on the synthetic panel
     of `test_group_cap.py` so the proof does not depend on data/ being present.
  2. FULL TARGET, NOT THE EDGE. With the flag True and a flat book, the emitted
     weights must EQUAL the pre-band target (built by the same sleeve with the
     band removed and the calendar at 1 day, so the signal date is identical),
     must be dollar-neutral, and must DIFFER from the band-edge book -- or the
     switch did nothing.
  3. ORDER OF OPERATIONS. The switch replaces only the band: the group cap still
     acts before it (synthetic panel, where the cap binds) and the gross/margin
     cap still acts after it (a deliberately tight cap, so it binds on any date).
  4. REFUSAL. The flag with a live book RAISES: re-targeting a held book past its
     band is a runner bug, and a sleeve that silently obeyed would churn every
     name. A non-bool flag raises too: whether the band exists must not be
     decided by Python truthiness.

`data/` is gitignored, so the real-panel tests SKIP, naming the missing file,
when the panel is absent; the synthetic tests always run.
