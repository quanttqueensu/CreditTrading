"""The two v7 constraints: `group_cap` and `max_gross_stress`.

WHY THESE FIVE TESTS AND NOT OTHERS. The house rule is a test with any change to
the live path, and the useful ones are the ones that would have caught a real
class of defect in this repo:

  1. THE NO-OP.  `band_width` was activated on the promise that the code change
     alone did nothing, and that promise was verified by diffing sleeve output.
     Two new keys make the same promise. A no-op that is asserted and not tested
     rots the first time someone edits the block above it -- so this pins that
     the keys ABSENT and the keys PRESENT-BUT-NULL produce byte-identical
     targets, reasons included.
  2. THE CAP BINDS.  A constraint that silently never fires is worse than none:
     it reads as protection in every document and provides none. This builds a
     book whose net group weight is far outside k and requires that it comes
     back to exactly k, dollar-neutrally, with no name dropped.
  3. SCALING, NOT FLATTENING.  The failure mode a margin rule invites is
     "reduce" implemented as "get out". This requires the gross cap to land on
     the cap exactly, keep every name, keep every sign, and keep every RATIO
     between names.
  4. GROUPS COME FROM THE SPEC UNIVERSE'S STATED MANDATE, read from the panel's
     `grp` column -- not from returns, not from a hard-coded list in the sleeve.
     A grouping fitted to returns would be fitted to the thing being
     neutralised. This pins that relabelling a name in the panel moves which
     side of the cap it sits on.
  5. REFUSAL.  NO SILENT FALLBACKS. A missing `grp` must raise naming the
     names, not default them to one side. A defaulted mandate puts a name on
     the wrong side of the very constraint being applied and nothing downstream
     notices.

Synthetic panel throughout, in the house style of `test_band_hold_dust.py`: the
mechanism must be provably correct on toy inputs, independent of whatever the
live parquet happens to hold today. The ONE place the real numbers are checked
is `ng/store/deploy/gc_score.py`, which asserts the sleeve reproduces GN-N2's
published table on the pinned snapshot before it will print anything.
