"""Live P&L attribution of the cef paper account: hold, fill, fees, NAV, discount, distributions.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-11-02)
----------------------------
The cef paper account lost $982.14 on Alpaca's end-of-day portfolio history from
2026-09-28 to 2026-10-30, 24 sessions [V: read-only GETs by the main session,
2026-11-02]. That session explained the loss by hand. It rebuilt positions from
the account's 344 FILL activities, marked them at SIP daily closes, and split
what was held into what each fund's NAV did and what its discount did. The split
said the loss was NAV, not discount:
  * the NAV part was -$2,251 and the discount part +$1,583;
  * the muni shorts MQY and MHD lost $1,849 on NAV alone, as muni NAVs rose
    4-5% from 10-14 to 10-30 while the taxable names' NAVs moved -0.9% to +0.5%;
  * discounts narrowed in both legs, which is the signal's own bet
[V: same session, scratchpad scripts, not in the repo]. A figure that drives
the book's next decision has to be re-derivable (CLAUDE.md: double-check
anything that drives a decision). This module turns that one-off pass into a
tool with two steps. The second step can be tested, and replayed without keys:

  fetch    read-only GETs plus keyless yfinance -> a cache directory
  analyse  the cache only -> CSVs and a markdown summary

It is research and never on the live path. Nothing in quantt/ or src/deploy/
imports it. It writes nothing the book decides on, it refuses to write under
data/ (CLAUDE.md landmine 9), and it holds no order code. The only broker
methods it calls are the client's GETs.

THE DECOMPOSITION (name s, session t, previous session p)
-----------------------------------------------------------
q_prev is the signed number of shares at p's close, rebuilt from fills (long > 0,
short < 0). For each name and session:

  hold      = q_prev * (close_t - close_p)           the position held into t
  fill      = sum_f signed_qty_f * (close_t - px_f)   each fill against t's close
  nav_part  = q_prev * close_p * (NAV_t / NAV_p - 1)  what the fund's NAV did
  disc_part = hold - nav_part                         what its discount did
  dist      = q_prev * cash_per_share(ex-date == t)   what a real account books

and, once per session over all names (FEES below):

  fees      = -( ceil_cent(SEC rate * value sold on t) + ceil_cent(CAT rate * shares traded on t) )

hold + fill is the account's price P&L. hold + fill summed over names, plus the
session's fees, should equal Alpaca's end-of-day equity change. Every session's
residual (the EOD change minus that sum) is printed beside the value sold that session, and a
WARN line marks any residual above RESIDUAL_WARN_USD. nav_part is what the
holder would have made if the price had moved with the NAV (a constant
discount). disc_part is the rest: the discount's move. Long and short follow
from the sign of q_prev, so a short whose fund's NAV rises has a negative
nav_part.

FEES: PAPER CHARGES THEM AFTER ALL (review 2026-11-02)
------------------------------------------------------
The first build said paper "charges no fees" and called the residual a one-cent
difference between Alpaca's mark and the SIP close. Its own output said
otherwise. On the converted cache to 2026-10-30 the residual against hold + fill
was negative on 19 of 24 sessions, zero on the 5 with no fill, never positive,
-$6.16 in all, and it tracked the value sold: about $21.1 per $1M sold and
$0.7 per $1M bought, R2 0.9996 (a no-intercept fit over the 23 sessions after
2026-09-29) [V: the reviewer's script and the counts, re-run 2026-11-02]. A
mark difference has no sign and no tie to sales. This was a cash flow.

It is, to the cent, Alpaca's LIVE regulatory-fee schedule charged per session:
the SEC fee on the session's value sold (sells and short sales) at SEC_FEE_PER_
USD_SOLD, plus FINRA CAT on the session's shares traded (buys and sells) at
CAT_FEE_PER_SHARE, each summed over the session and rounded UP to the cent. That
rule reproduces the residual exactly on 24 of 24 sessions: analyse on that cache
now leaves a residual of exactly 0 (in Fraction) on every session [V: re-run
2026-11-02]. The rounding unit was found by search, in a scratchpad check: 3 x
3 x 4 x 3 x 2 variants were tried (per fill, order or session; up, half or
none; CAT on both sides or sells only). The next best matched 13 of 24. Alpaca's
paper page says paper does not simulate regulatory fees (docs/REFERENCES.md,
the paper-trading rows [V: page fetched 2026-10-13]). The page and the account disagree,
and this module follows the account. That the charge IS these fees, and not
something equal to them, stays [U] until the account's FEE activities are read
(that needs keys; this module reads only FILLs).

So the fees line is modelled from the schedule and labelled as such. It is
reported per session and in total, never per name: it is rounded per session,
so it does not split exactly by name. fill + fees is paper's execution cost:
-$314.87 on that cache, against -$308.71 for fill alone [V: re-run 2026-11-02].
With the residual at 0, it now measures what the model misses: a missed fill, a wrong
sign, a mark difference, or a new SEC rate. A new rate shows as a residual in
proportion to the value sold, which is why daily.csv carries both.

The arithmetic is done in fractions.Fraction, on the decimal strings the sources
publish. nav_part + disc_part == hold therefore holds exactly, and so does each
session's reconciliation sum: no float rounding can hide a term. Floats appear
only in the written tables.

DISTRIBUTIONS: WHAT PAPER DOES NOT CREDIT
-----------------------------------------
Alpaca paper credits no distributions [V: docs.alpaca.markets/us/docs/
paper-trading, fetched 2026-09-28; CLAUDE.md landmine 1]. The account recorded
0 DIV activities over the window [V: main session, 2026-11-02]. On a CEF's
ex-date the price falls by about the distribution. A paper long loses that drop
with nothing credited back. A paper short gains it without paying its lender.
`dist` is therefore never part of the equity reconciliation. It is the third
line beside it (team lead 2026-10-09, `docs/SYSTEM.md` §5), and it follows both
halves of prod's rule (`quantt/session/dist_score.py`):

  * entitlement: the holder at the previous close is entitled on the ex-date. A
    long is credited, a short is charged, and shares traded on the ex-date
    trade ex and earn nothing;
  * resolution (review 2026-11-02): for a held name-day the amount comes from
    `dist_score.resolve` itself. It is called with Alpaca's records and a second
    source fetched into the cache, yfinance `Ticker.dividends` (the vendor of
    prod's panel, data/cef/cef_distributions.parquet). Alpaca's silence is not
    a zero. A zero needs both sources silent, with the second covering the name
    and fetched after the close of the session following the ex-date
    (`dist_score.panel_judgement`). Anything else is UNMEASURED: that name-day's
    dist is None, the line's total is UNMEASURED (a sum with a missing term is
    not the sum), and a GAP names each case.

The first build copied only the entitlement half. It counted any name-day that
Alpaca did not list as zero, so an ex-date late in the window, whose record
Alpaca had not published yet, would have made the line silently low. Prod's
third score booked +$320.85 on 10-13..10-15. The main session's independent
recompute holds the same +$320.85, which its script printed rounded as 321
[V: reviewer, 2026-11-02]. Cash dividends and capital-gains distributions both
count, as in `AlpacaClient.distributions` and dist_score. A cache that did not
query a kind says so in the summary as a GAP. The total is then labelled with
the kinds it covers.

EX-DATES AND THE DISCOUNT PART: A CONVENTION (review 2026-11-02)
----------------------------------------------------------------
On an ex-date, price and NAV both fall by about the distribution D. Write the
previous discount as d = 1 - close_p / NAV_p. If each falls by exactly D, then
hold = -q_prev * D and nav_part = -q_prev * D * close_p / NAV_p, so disc_part =
-q_prev * D * d. The dollar gap is unchanged, but the NAV under it is smaller,
so the discount is wider in percent. That mechanical widening lands in
disc_part: it counts against a long at a discount and for a short. It is not
the signal's discount bet. On the converted cache to 2026-10-30 it was -$61.28
on the long side (7 ex-date name-days) and +$63.16 on the short side (5), net
+$1.88, under the model that price and NAV each fall by exactly the
distribution. Neither leg's discount part changes sign (long +$1,031.36, short
+$552.12) [V: the reviewer's figures, re-run from name_day 2026-11-02]. The
module does not compute this split; it is a reading aid, not a line.
dist is the other half of the same event: a real account's ex-date P&L is
hold + dist.

THE NAV-ALIGNMENT CAVEAT
------------------------
yfinance serves stale vendor copies of some NAVs: a row dated D that carries
NAV(D-1) (results/cef/LIVE_NAV_QUALITY_2026-10-12.md; docs/REFERENCES.md §12h).
A stale copy moves P&L between nav_part and disc_part for those two days: the
NAV move is booked a day late, and disc_part absorbs the difference on both. It
never changes hold, fill or the reconciliation, which use only prices and fills.
A NAV split over a short window is therefore less certain than its sum; a split
over weeks, like the one above, mostly washes the lag out.

WHAT IT REFUSES (raises, naming what is missing; never a default)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  * a missing close, where one is needed: a held name on t or p, or a traded
    name on t;
  * a missing NAV on a held name-day (t or p);
  * a fill on a day with no bar for its symbol, or on a day that is not a
    session of the EOD history;
  * duplicate FILL activity ids, which would count a fill twice;
  * a split, or any other share-count corporate action, naming a traded symbol
    in the window. Paper processes no corporate actions [V: docs/REFERENCES.md
    §12pc], so the account's share count would no longer match the price;
  * a cache that cannot show the account was flat when the rebuild starts
    (`check_flat_start`), or that did not query splits;
  * a fill on or before the first EOD point (it cannot be reconciled), a bar on
    a date the EOD history lacks, an ex-date that is not a session (in either
    distribution source), a traded symbol with no `grp` in
    data/cef/cef_universe.csv, and two identical distribution records under
    different ids (Alpaca once published a doubled QQQ record,
    scripts/rv/alpaca_daily.py);
  * a cache without the second distribution source, its fetch time, or the
    session after its last EOD point;
  * a write under data/, or of any file git could see in this repository.
No fillna on any price or NAV. A NAV or close that is present but not a finite
positive number counts as missing, and the error says so. A distribution that
cannot be resolved is UNMEASURED, never zero.

USAGE
-----
    python3 scripts/cef/live_attribution.py fetch   [--cache-dir D] [--asof YYYY-MM-DD] [--since YYYY-MM-DD]
    python3 scripts/cef/live_attribution.py analyse [--cache-dir D] [--out-dir D] [--asof YYYY-MM-DD]
                                                    [--break YYYY-MM-DD ...]

The cache holds the account's fills and equity series, and the analyse outputs
hold the same kind of data: daily.csv carries the account's EOD equity for every
session, and name_day.csv and positions_end.csv carry its positions. This
repository is public. Both default directories (results/cef/live_attribution/
_cache and _out) are gitignored, and both steps refuse to write any file that
git could see inside the repository (`_refuse_git_visible`, review 2026-11-02:
the first build's default --out-dir was visible). A directory outside the
repository is allowed. Whether any output may be committed is the team lead's
call; until then nothing can be. fetch reads the cef book's keys only through the existing loader
(`scripts/rv/alpaca_daily.make_client` -> `AlpacaClient.from_environment`, the
file named by QUANTT_ENV_FILE) and never prints them.
