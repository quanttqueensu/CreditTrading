WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
C4's holdout (CEF trial 52, opened once on 2026-10-18) booked four IGR bars of
`data/cef_families/cef_prices.parquet` -- 2026-07-29, 08-04, 08-07 and 08-11 --
that were on the post-split basis (about 14.2) inside a raw pre-split series
(about 4.7), weeks before IGR's 1:3 reverse split of 2026-09-08, with the NAV
flat. The declared yfinance formula booked each as +200% and then -66.7%; the
band held a stale IGR short through them, and they cost -10.87% of capital
(`results/cef/C4_RESULT_2026-10-14.md` §8). Two failures let them through, and
each guard here closes one:

1. Nothing on the return path looked at them. `split_like_spikes` finds a close
   that jumps by a split-like factor and comes back within a short window while
   the NAV does not make the move; `guard_closes` RAISES (`SpikeRevertError`),
   naming every offending (ticker, date, ratio), unless a recorded rulings file
   says what to do with each bar. C4's `yf_total_returns` calls it.
2. Stage 0 had flagged all eight IGR rows (Q5) on 2026-10-14, and nobody ruled
   on the flags before P&L was formed. `require_stage0_rulings` refuses
   (`Stage0BlockError`), naming the flags, while any Stage-0 flag lacks a
   recorded ruling in the trial's rulings file. A trial script calls it before
   it forms any P&L.
3. (Added 2026-10-20.) A recorded split applied to a close the vendor had already
   split-adjusted books the factor k twice: BTO, TYG, NXG and EMO in C4's fit, at
   -75% to -80%, through the formula the spike guard leaves alone.
   `guard_split_basis` RAISES (`SplitBasisError`), naming (ticker, ex-date,
   factor), when the series makes no split-sized step on the ex-date, so k would
   create one. Only a recorded split rulings file overrides it.
   `band_frontier.total_returns` calls it, and so does C4's NAV catch-up.

NO SILENT REPAIR. Neither guard alters a number on its own. The only alteration
is a ruled treatment, read from a file that names who ruled, when, and why, and
the corrected series is re-scanned before it is returned. A ruling that names a
bar the scan no longer finds raises too (the data changed under the ruling).

panels on 2026-10-19: `results/cef/DATA_GUARDS_2026-10-19.md`.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- the spike-and-revert rule
#
# THE TOLERANCE, DERIVED (not swept). A bar on the wrong basis is the true close
# times the split factor f exactly: a vendor's split-adjusted history is the raw
# print times the split ratio. So the close ratio the formula books on the bar is
#     C(t) / C(t-1) = f * (1 + e),
# where e is the fund's GENUINE one-day move that day. The tolerance around f
# must therefore admit any genuine one-day move the desk treats as ordinary, and
# no more. The desk already declares that line: P2's Q5 screen flags |r| > 15%
# as an outlier (`results/xasset/PREREG_XASSET_SLATE_2026-10-12.md` §Q5, cited by
# C4's pre-registration §4.5; `c4_families.Q5_ABS`, which a test pins equal to
# this constant). A move beyond it is not ordinary by the desk's own rule, so
#     tau = ln(1 + 0.15) = 0.1398 in log ratio,
# i.e. a ratio within [f / 1.15, f * 1.15]. Two checks on that value, neither of
# which chose it: (i) tau < ln(3/2) / 2 = 0.2027, so the bands around the two
# commonest split factors, 2 and 3, do not overlap and the factor a bar is ruled
# on is unambiguous; (ii) tau < ln 2, so a ratio of 1 (no defect) is never
# split-like. For factors of 4 and above the bands touch, and every jump of
# about x3.5 or more is split-like: no genuine one-day CEF move is that large.
#
# The same tau decides the two other comparisons, for the same reason:
# * NAV "makes the move" when its own one-day log ratio over the same two bars
#   is within tau of the price's. If it does, price and NAV agree, the bar is a
#   genuine (if extraordinary) day or a basis change in both panels, and this
#   guard is not the place to judge it. If it does not -- including a flat NAV,
#   the IGR case -- the price moved by a split factor that the fund's assets did
#   not. Where NAV is missing on either bar the price alone decides (the task's
#   "where available"), so a fund with no NAV is guarded, not exempted.
# * The spike REVERTS when a later step within the window is split-like in the
#   opposite direction AND brings the close back to within tau of its level
#   before the jump. The round trip, not the size of the return step, is the
#   test, so a genuine move on either bar cannot make the factors disagree.
#
# THE WINDOW is a choice, stated as one: REVERT_WINDOW = 5 sessions (one trading
# week) is the longest wrong-basis run this guard calls a spike. Each IGR bar
# reverted the next session. A wrong-basis run longer than a week is a level
# break, not a spike; it is still REPORTED by `split_like_spikes` (the
# `unreverted` table, which the scan prints), so nothing beyond the window is
# silent -- it is not raised, because an unrecorded genuine split looks the same
# from the price alone. The scan reports the hit count at W = 1 and W = 21 and
# at tau/2 and 2*tau beside the declared values, computed after the choice and
# never used to make it.
#
# SPLITS. Returns are booked on the split-corrected ratio C(t)/C(t-1) * k(t)
# (`band_frontier.total_returns`), with k the share-count multiplier of the
# actions file (yfinance codes IGR's 1:3 reverse split as 0.3333). The guard
# scans that same quantity: each close (and NAV) is multiplied by the product of
# the multipliers whose ex-date is on or before it, so a recorded split is not a
# jump, and a wrong-basis bar just before a split date is still a spike.

# 2026-10-19). `band_frontier.total_returns` books r = (1 + r_px) * k - 1 on a recorded split's
# ex-date. That is right when the close is RAW: it steps by 1/k there and k undoes the step. It is
# wrong when the vendor had ALREADY split-adjusted the history, so the close has no step: k is then
# booked a second time, as a phantom return of k - 1. yfinance back-adjusts its close for every
# split it knows of on the day of the fetch (`scripts/data/cef_families_quality.split_factor` relies
# on that), while its actions file still records the split. In C4's fit this booked BTO 2008-12-30,
# TYG 2020-05-01, NXG 2020-06-15 and EMO 2020-07-28 at -74.7% to -80.3%. On each of those dates
# CRSP's raw print steps by 1/k and yfinance's close does not. Only the report-only R-yf row moved
# (1.131 -> 1.130), and nothing raised (results/cef/DATA_GUARDS_2026-10-19.md §6 item 2).
#
# THE RULE is applied to the step the formula actually books. It looks at each cell where a factor
# k != 1 multiplies a finite raw one-step return r: exactly the cells `total_returns` changes, so a
# split on a day with no return, which multiplies nothing, is not judged. With x = ln(1 + r):
#     raw basis:       x = -ln k + e
#     adjusted basis:  x = e
# Here e is the fund's genuine move that day, and |e| <= tau, the desk's line for an ordinary day.
# This is the spike guard's tau (SPLIT_TOL above), derived there and not re-chosen here. The two
# readings cannot both hold when |ln k| > 2 tau = ln(1.15^2), i.e. when k lies outside
# [0.756, 1.3225]: every reverse split, and every forward split of 4:3 or more. For such a split:
#     |x| <= tau          ADJUSTED. Applying k creates a step of about k (or 1/k) that the raw
#                         series did not have. RAISES `SplitBasisError`, naming (ticker, ex-date,
#                         factor), unless a recorded ruling treats the cell.
#     |x + ln k| <= tau   raw. k is right; nothing happens.
#     neither             the step fits neither basis (for example, a split recorded on the wrong
#                         day, or a genuine day beyond the desk's line on the ex-date). Reported by
#                         the scan, never raised: it is not this defect, and the guard was not asked
#                         to judge it.
# BELOW 2 tau THE GUARD HAS NO POWER, and says so rather than guess. A 1.029 split is smaller than
# an ordinary day, and the price alone cannot tell the two bases apart. `split_basis_check` labels
# such a cell `undecidable`, the scan prints every one, and nothing is raised. Raising there would
# raise on the live book's one recorded split (BIT 2025-08-19, 1.029), whose raw close does step
# (band_frontier.split_factor's docstring: 14.47 -> 13.84). It would raise on a correct series
# because of a test that cannot see.
#
# THE OVERRIDE is a recorded rulings file, as for the spike guard (`load_split_rulings`): who
# ruled, when, where it is written down, and one entry per (ticker, ex-date, series), with the
# factor the ruling was made on. The treatments:
#     drop_split   the series is already on the post-split basis on that day, so the cell's factor
#                  is set to 1 and the booked step is the series' own.
#     book_as_is   apply k as recorded. Used for a script whose purpose is to reproduce a committed
#                  computation that booked it; the reason must say so.
# `series` is "close" or "nav". The two can sit on different bases for one fund (AWP 2026-02-09:
# yfinance's close is adjusted, its NAV is not), so a ruling names the one it was made on.
