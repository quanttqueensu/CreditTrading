"""Report-only exposure readout: the book's MUNI exposure (headline) and TERM / CREDIT / LOANS (indicative), per day.

ZERO TRIALS. IT READS A BOOK AND REPORTS. IT NEVER TRADES.

WHY THIS EXISTS (team lead, 2026-11-02)
---------------------------------------
The live attribution of the cef paper account (results/cef/LIVE_ATTRIBUTION_2026-11-02.md,
PR #26) split its 09-29..10-30 loss into a discount part (the signal's leg) that made money
and a NAV part that lost it, most of it in the muni shorts as muni NAVs rose against
taxable ones [S: that note]. The Sharpe-framed NAV hedge was screened the same day and
CLOSED at the power gate (results/cef/NAVHEDGE_SCREEN_2026-11-02.md). The team lead
approved this readout in its place: position-based daily telemetry of the live book's
exposure to rates, HY credit, munis and loans, so that the next muni-vs-taxable move is
measured, not inferred from a few weeks of P&L. It is the deleted `/api/factors`, rebuilt.

It holds no order code, imports nothing from quantt/ or src/deploy/, reads no key and
opens no broker connection. Its only network call is keyless yfinance, in `fetch`.
Nothing on the live path imports it. A test pins all of that.

THE FACTORS, AND WHY THEY ARE ORTHOGONALISED
--------------------------------------------
TERM = IEF, CREDIT = HYG, MUNI = MUB, LOANS = BKLN, each a daily TOTAL return (below).

Collinearity was measured first (`derive`, fit era 2011-03-04 .. 2022-12-30, 2,978
sessions, after BKLN's first return) [V: derive, re-run 2026-11-02]:
  * full-era correlations: IEF-MUB +0.394, HYG-BKLN +0.703, MUB-HYG +0.305,
    MUB-BKLN +0.342, IEF-HYG -0.100, IEF-BKLN -0.135; VIF 1.32 / 1.48 / 2.01 / 2.14
    (IEF, MUB, HYG, BKLN); condition number of the correlation matrix 6.67;
  * but the readout estimates on a 252-session window, and there the pairs are much
    tighter and unstable. Over the era's rolling windows: IEF-MUB median +0.64, up to
    +0.83; HYG-BKLN median +0.63, up to +0.88; IEF-HYG changes sign, -0.59 to +0.50;
    MUB-HYG -0.48 to +0.64. Rolling VIF median about 1.8, max 4.5;
  * netting IEF out of the other three is not enough. The residuals MUB|IEF and HYG|IEF
    still correlate up to +0.75 (p95 +0.66), and BKLN|IEF with HYG|IEF up to +0.83
    (median +0.63).
The VIFs alone would not call this severe. The reason to orthogonalise is what the readout
reports: each factor's vol contribution |E_k| x sigma_k, read one factor at a time, and a
review rule on it. That number is the factor's contribution only if the cross terms
2 E_j E_k rho_jk sigma_j sigma_k are small, and with window correlations of 0.6-0.9 they
are as large as the own terms. Offsetting raw betas (long MUB, short IEF) would each look
large and cancel. So the four are orthogonalised by Gram-Schmidt on each window, in this
order, general to specific:
  TERM   = IEF                                  (every ETF here carries duration)
  CREDIT = HYG  net of IEF                      (HY spread, beyond rates)
  MUNI   = MUB  net of IEF and HYG              (the muni-vs-taxable move this exists for)
  LOANS  = BKLN net of IEF, HYG and MUB         (the floating-rate remainder)
Each is a tradable spread return: the ETF less its window OLS slopes times the earlier
ETFs (the intercept is not subtracted, so the factor stays a return). On the window the
four are exactly uncorrelated in sample, so the factor variance of the book is the sum of
the squared contributions on that window. CREDIT comes before MUNI because a joint
muni-and-HY sell-off (outflows, a risk-off week) is a general credit move. MUNI is then
what munis did that Treasuries and taxable HY did not. That is the muni-vs-taxable
dimension, and it is where the order matters most: the MUB|IEF and HYG|IEF residuals are
near zero in the median window but +0.66 at p95. The framework's fixed differences
(MUB - IEF, HYG - IEF; PORTFOLIO_FRAMEWORK_2026-10-15 §3.1) do not orthogonalise: the
window OLS slope of MUB on IEF has a median of +0.33 in the fit era, not 1.

Orthogonalising changes how the exposure is SPLIT, never its total. On the window the
orthogonal set spans the same space as the raw ETFs, so the fitted values, and the total
factor P&L sum_k E_k f_k, are identical in either basis; a test pins that.

DIMSON LAGS: THE LEAD-PLACEBO RULE (team lead, 2026-11-02: re-derive L before the next reading)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A CEF's close can trail the ETFs' closes: the fund trades thinner, and its price partly
anchors to a NAV that is struck from stale evaluated bond prices (W4 measured NAV AC(1) of
+0.26 to +0.54 by group; results/cef/W4_ARTIFACTS_2026-10-11.md §3 [S]). Dimson (1979)
regresses on the factor at t, t-1, ..., t-L and sums the betas. The exposure uses that sum:
the whole eventual response of the price to a factor move.

THE RULE. Written into this module, with its tests, and committed on its own (09d3dad,
2026-11-02 22:02:51 New York time) before it was first run on any data. No alternative to
it was computed before that commit.
`lead_placebo_counts` makes the counts and `placebo_lag_rule` decides; `derive` runs both.
  Data      the cache's total returns, cut at FIT_END (2022-12-30) BEFORE anything is
            shifted, so no response, lag or lead is dated 2023 or later (H13;
            `lead_placebo_counts` raises if one is). The four ETFs orthogonalised once on the
            whole fit era, in FACTORS order. Names: the frozen spec's UNIVERSE, read at run
            time; the pairs are names x 4 factors (52 on 13 names).
  Model     ONE OLS per name: its daily total return on a constant, the four factors at lags
            0..K and the four factors at leads 1..J, with HAC (Newey-West, 5 lags) standard
            errors, on every session where all of them exist. K = DERIVE_MAX_LAG = 10, the
            bound W4 used for its NAV-staleness sensitivity. J = DERIVE_RULE_LEADS = 19.
  Counts    c(l), l = 0..K: pairs whose lag-l coefficient has a two-sided p < 0.05.
            p(j), j = 1..J: pairs whose lead-j coefficient does. Same model, same sample.
  Bound     T = max over j of p(j): the largest count the placebo produced.
  Decision  Lag 0 must have c(0) > T, or the rule raises: the factors would then explain the
            funds no better than their future returns, and no L means anything. Then for
            l = 1, 2, ..., K in that order, lag l is included if and only if c(l) > T,
            strictly. L is the last lag included before the first lag that is not.
  Ties      c(l) = T does not include lag l, and it stops the sequence.
  Gaps      A lag that clears T after a lag that did not is NOT included: the Dimson sum
            needs lags 0..L without a hole, and the sequence below needs the stop.
  Censoring If every lag 1..K clears T the rule raises. L would then be censored at K; K is
            widened only under a new rule declared first, and K is never taken as the answer.
WHY EACH PIECE
  * The null is a placebo, not Binomial(52, 0.05). A lead coefficient loads the fund's
    return on the factor's FUTURE return. With the lags in the model it has no causal
    channel unless the fund leads the ETF. So its count is what 5% noise produces under the
    real dependence among 13 co-moving funds' t-statistics, which a Binomial treats as 52
    independent draws: the review's 5-lead placebo reached 18 against a Binomial 95% point
    of 5 (below). Lags and leads come from ONE model per name so that they share the
    residuals, the HAC weights, the sample and the design; the leads are then the nearest
    available copies of a lag that carries nothing.
  * q is the maximum of J = 19 lead counts. If lag l carries no response, its count is
    (assumed) exchangeable with the 19 lead counts, and the chance that it strictly exceeds
    all 19 is at most 1/20 = 0.05. That is the placebo's 95% point in the rank sense. It
    matches the 5% that each pair is counted at, and it needs no quantile interpolated from
    a small sample. J = 19 is the fewest leads at which the maximum gives a 5% test
    (1/(J + 1) <= 0.05); a test pins that relation.
  * The fixed order. Testing lags 1, 2, ... in a declared order, each at 5%, and stopping at
    the first that fails keeps the chance of including ANY null lag at 5% with no
    multiplicity adjustment: including a null lag requires including the first null lag in
    the order, and that is one 5% event.
  * The tie. Strict ">" keeps the rank test at or below 5% when counts tie. A lag that only
    matches the largest placebo count has not shown more than the placebo.
  * Risks, stated and not corrected. (a) If a fund does lead an ETF, some lead counts are
    not null: T is then too high and L too short. (b) Exchangeability of lag and lead counts
    is an assumption [U]. (c) The 19 lead counts are correlated with each other, so the
    maximum comes from fewer than 19 effective draws [U how many].
    [Added after the result, 2026-11-02; the rule above is unchanged: on this data the lead
    counts are not null draws. One episode inflates some of them, so T is too high, which is
    (a)'s effect by another cause. See WHAT L = 0 DOES AND DOES NOT SHOW, below.]
WHAT WAS IN SIGHT WHEN THE RULE WAS WRITTEN: the review's figures below (the lags-only counts
at K = 10 and the five lead counts), all of 2026-11-02. No piece of the rule (K, J, the 5% per
pair, HAC(5), the maximum, the tie, the stop, the single joint model) was computed on data
before the commit that declared it. One consequence was visible in advance: the review's
lead-1 count (18) exceeds every lags-only count from lag 1 on, so if the 19-lead maximum
lands near it, this rule gives L = 0. That outcome was accepted in advance. The rule is not
re-tuned after it runs, and any change to it lands in a commit of its own, before it is run.

The plateau check sits beside it, as before, and nothing is chosen from it: `derive` prints
the muni names' summed MUNI beta at every L, and `analyse --plateau` the per-factor review
counts at L - 1 .. L + 2.

THE RULE'S RESULT: L = 0, so DIMSON_LAGS = 0 [V: `derive`, run 2026-11-02 at 22:02:56 New
York time, 5 s after the commit that declared the rule (09d3dad, 22:02:51 -0500). The cache
was asof RULE_CACHE_ASOF (2026-10-30), and its prices.parquet hashes to RULE_CACHE_SHA256;
`derive` prints whether the cache it reads is that one. Sample 2011-03-18 .. 2022-12-02, the
last response row, whose lead-19 row is 2022-12-30. 464 to 2,949 sessions per name; PDO
starts 2021-02-02]:
  lag counts  c(0..10)  46 18 16  8  4 12 14 13  6  7 17                      (of 52 pairs)
  lead counts p(1..19)  12  6 12 16  8 13 13 12 14 11  7 11 19 18  3  4  1  5  5
  T = 19, at lead 13. Lag 1's count is 18, not above 19, so the sequence stops at lag 1.
  The margin is thin: L leaves 0 if lag 1 gains 2 pairs, or if lead 13 loses 2 and lead 14
  loses 1. That is why the cache's hash is recorded beside the counts.

WHAT L = 0 DOES AND DOES NOT SHOW. The review of this result (2026-11-02) measured most of
what follows. The session that fixed the review's findings added the year control, the
trend test with no cut and the offset-for-offset comparison of far lags and leads.
`derive` section 2b prints every count and rate below [V: re-run 2026-11-02 in this module,
and by a second implementation that builds the episode mask from dates, with identical
counts]. All of it came after the result. Nothing was chosen from it, the rule was not re-run
on it, and the episode's window and the lead cut at 14 were picked by the review after it
had seen the counts.
  * L = 0 is what the declared rule outputs. It is NOT evidence that the lags carry nothing.
    The rule reads T as the largest of 19 null draws, and on this data T is not that.
  * One episode sets T. The 19 significant pairs at lead 13 are all taxable funds (no MHD or
    MQY): 18 CREDIT or LOANS pairs and PCN's MUNI, every coefficient negative. Drop, from
    every name, the rows whose regressor span t-10..t+19 touches 2020-02-20 .. 2020-04-30
    (79 rows of a full-sample name, 2.7% of it; PDO, which starts in 2021, loses none).
    Lead rejections fall from 190/988 (19.2%) to 86/988 (8.7%), lags 4..10 from 73/364
    (20.1%) to 38/364 (10.4%), lead 13's count from 19 to 5, and the largest lead count from
    19 to 10. The lag counts become 45 14 10 4 3 6 10 1 4 7 7, on which the same decision
    step would give L = 1. That is the review's reading, disclosed and not adopted.
  * The control. Dropping each calendar year in turn instead (its rows and those whose span
    reaches into it): for every year but 2020, lead rejections stay at 19.1% to 21.0% and the
    largest lead count at 18 to 21. Dropping 2020 gives 7.9% and 8. It is the episode, not
    the loss of any one year of rows.
  * Exchangeability, measured. Every lead count at 1..14 (smallest 6) is above every count at
    15..19 (largest 5): 172/728 tests (23.6%) against 18/260 (6.9%). The review put the
    chance of that, under exchangeable counts, at 1/C(19,5) = 1/11,628, or about 1.5e-3
    "allowing for the 18 possible cut points". That allowance is too small. The cut was
    chosen after seeing the counts, and over every cut 1..18 the chance of some such clean
    split is at most the sum of 1/C(19,k), 0.12 [V: arithmetic], and about 0.11 [V: 400,000
    random orders, seed 0; not printed by derive]. A test that needs no cut,
    the Spearman trend of count on lead with a permutation null, gives rho -0.45, one-sided
    p 0.025 and two-sided p 0.053 [V: derive 2b, 20,000 permutations, seed 0]. So the order
    of the lead counts alone is suggestive, not decisive. What shows that T is not a null
    draw is the episode recount and its control.
  * Direction. An episode that inflates some lead counts raises T, so on this data the rule
    leans conservative: L too short, as in risk (a). How far is [U].
  * Far lags against far leads, offset for offset (lags 0..19 beside leads 1..19, full
    sample): at offsets 11..14 lags reject 13.9% and leads 28.8%; at 15..19, 10.8% and 6.2%;
    over 11..19, 12.2% and 16.2%. The review set lags 11..19 (12.2%) beside leads 15..19
    (6.2%), which are different offsets. Offset for offset, the far leads reject at least as
    often as the far lags overall, so that comparison does not show the lags falling off more
    slowly than the leads.
  * The cause of the excess, corrected. This docstring said, after the result, that "either
    the HAC(5) tests on these funds are oversized about fourfold, or the returns carry
    structure at every offset", and that "no single name drives it". Most of the excess is
    the one episode, and it sits in the taxable funds. By name, leads reject 27 of 76 tests
    for BIT, 16 to 20 for AWF, DSL, HYT, JFR, PCN and PFN, 8 to 13 for PDI, PDO, PHK and PTY,
    and 7 for each muni fund, against 3.8 at 5%. With the episode dropped, BIT rejects 13 and
    every other name 2 to 9. Whether the episode is real crash-and-rebound dynamics or a HAC
    test losing its size on a few extreme cross-products is [U]. A wider Newey-West bandwidth
    corrects for serial correlation; nothing here shows it would correct either. Even with
    the episode dropped, leads reject 8.7% against 5%.
  * By name, the muni funds show the clearest lag response. MHD and MQY reject 6 and 8 of
    their 12 lag 1..3 tests and 7 of their 76 lead tests each [V: derive 2b]. The rule pools
    all 52 pairs and does not look by group. That is a property of the rule as declared; the
    rule was not re-run on it.
  * The plateau at L = 0 is the median cumulative summed beta by group, from the lags-only
    0..10 models; L - 1 does not exist. The muni group's MUNI beta is 1.03 at L = 0, 0.97 at
    L = 1 and 1.10 at L = 10, so that cell is level. The muni group's TERM beta is 0.40 at
    L = 0, 0.50 at 1 and 0.73 at 10, so that cell is not. The taxable groups' MUNI beta
    loses half or more from L = 0 to L = 1: hy 0.66 -> 0.11, multi 1.00 -> 0.40, loan
    1.01 -> 0.64. Loan TERM goes -0.26 -> -0.42 (-0.66 at L = 10).
  * At L = 0 the exposure is the same-day beta only. It no longer carries the staleness
    response that the Dimson sum was put in to catch. Each window's design falls from 17
    regressors to 5.
Whether to keep L = 0, knowing that T is set by March-April 2020, or to declare a different
rule first (one that withstands the episode, one by group, or neither) is the team lead's
call. A rule declared now would be written with the episode-dropped counts and the year
control in view, and must say so, as this one disclosed the counts it was written beside.
Any new rule is declared and committed before it runs, as this one was.

THE TEAM LEAD'S RULING (2026-11-03). Keep DIMSON_LAGS = 0, the declared rule's output, and
make MUNI the headline; TERM, CREDIT and LOANS are marked indicative. No new lag rule is
declared. THE RULE, DIMSON_LAGS, REVIEW_FRACTION and every computation are unchanged: the
five CSVs `analyse` writes are byte-identical before and after the change [V: diffed on
synthetic positions files, with and without equity and with --plateau, 2026-11-03]. Only the
order and headings of summary.md, which `analyse` also prints, changed (`summary_md`):
  * first, "Headline: MUNI": the review rule, then MUNI against it, MUNI per date (exposure,
    vol contribution, review flag), and the muni-vs-taxable group reading
    (`muni_vs_taxable`): the book's MUNI exposure from the muni group (grp `muni` in
    data/cef/cef_universe.csv) beside the taxable groups (every other grp), with the MUNI
    factor P&L by group;
  * then, under INDICATIVE_HEADING ("Indicative: depends on the lag choice (see DIMSON_LAGS
    docstring)"): TERM, CREDIT and LOANS against the rule and per date, the book totals
    (whose total factor vol sums all four factors) and the factor P&L of the three and of
    all four;
  * the plateau check, when asked for, stays last.
Each factor now gets its own line against the rule, "within the line" included; the first
build listed only the flagged ones, which would have left a MUNI within the line silent.
Why MUNI leads and the other three do not, from the fit-era plateau and the review counts
above [S: this docstring; not re-run for the ruling]: the muni group's MUNI beta is level
across L; the muni group's TERM beta moves with L, LOANS has no plateau at any L, and the
review counts moved more with L for TERM, CREDIT and LOANS than for MUNI. Even in the fit
era the book's MUNI exposure also sums the taxable funds' MUNI betas, and those move with L.
MEASURED WHILE RECORDING THE RULING (it changes nothing; whether it bears on the ruling was
the team lead's call, and on 2026-11-08 the team lead ruled: keep L = 0 and the MUNI headline). On the current window the muni funds' own MUNI beta is NOT level in
L. Summed MUNI beta on the 252 sessions strictly before 2026-10-30 (cache asof 2026-10-30),
at L = 0, 1, 2, 3: MHD +1.21 +1.49 +1.59 +1.65, MQY +1.27 +1.33 +1.44 +1.67; the taxable
names' group medians fall from L = 0 to L = 3 (hy +0.02 to -0.31, loan, JFR alone, -0.13 to
-0.55, multi +0.24 to -0.06) [V: `fit_window` on the 13 spec names, 2026-11-03, public
prices only; MHD, MQY, PDI and JFR re-derived by a second implementation, statsmodels' OLS
for both the Gram-Schmidt and the regression, agreeing to 2 dp]. So on this window a book
short munis and long taxable funds has a MUNI exposure that grows in size with L from both
sides. The fit-era level cell is a fit-era fact, and the headline at L = 0 is
the same-day beta, as every factor's is. Re-measure, never read these figures: `analyse
--plateau` prints the MUNI review counts and mean |E| at L = 0 .. 2 on the book read, and
`fit_window(...).beta_sum["MUNI"]` gives the names' betas at any L. If MUNI's reading moves
with L on the book read, the plateau rows show it beside the adopted row; if it does not,
they show that. The group reading sits in the headline so that the muni and taxable shares
of MUNI are read on every date, not assumed. A test pins the order.

THE RULES IT REPLACES (2026-11-02; history). DIMSON_LAGS = 3 came from this rule (`derive`,
fit era, 13 names, factors orthogonalised on the whole era, HAC(5)) [V: derive, re-run
2026-11-02]. For each lag l, count the (name, factor) pairs, of 52, whose lag-l coefficient
is significant at 5%, with lags 0..K in the model and K = 10. Take the first gap: L = the last
lag before the first lag whose count is within Binomial(52, 0.05)'s 95% point, 5. The counts
were 43, 14, 10, 7, 2 at lags 0..4, so L = 3. `derive` still prints it and the three rules
tried before it, labelled superseded; nothing is chosen from them.

The review of 2026-11-02 (finding 1) showed that the data pin this L weakly. `derive` now
prints the first three points below and `analyse --plateau` the fourth [V: both re-run
2026-11-02]:
  * The adopted rule was the fourth tried, all in one session, and the only one that gave
    3. The first build's docstring disclosed only the first. All four, at both lag bounds:
                                                              K = 5   K = 10
      joint Wald test of lag l, a majority of the 13 names      1       1    (tried first)
      sum of lags L+1..K, pairs within the bound                2       1
      single-lag first gap (adopted)                            2       3
    One (rule, K) pair of the six gives 3. The adopted rule gives 2 at K = 5.
  * The null bound fails a placebo. Binomial(52, 0.05) treats the 52 pairs as independent,
    and 13 co-moving funds are not. With five LEADS in the model (the factors' returns at
    t+1..t+5, which cannot cause anything), 18, 1, 9, 11 and 4 pairs come out significant:
    three of the five exceed 5. Under the first-gap rule a bound of 2-6 gives L = 3, 7-9
    gives 2, 10-13 gives 1, and 14 or more gives 0. The counts at lags 5..10 (12, 9, 12, 5,
    7, 10), which the first build read as a possible weekly flow pattern, sit in the same
    range as the lead counts, so noise under that dependence explains them as well [U which].
  * The plateau check picks a hump, not a plateau. The muni names' summed MUNI beta (group
    median) is 0.97 at L = 1, 1.13 at 2, 1.42 at 3, 1.38-1.40 at 4-5, 1.11-1.23 at 6-9 and
    1.10 at 10. L = 3 is the peak, 29% above the L = 10 value. The first build called
    L = 1 "about a third short"; that compared it to the peak, and against L = 10 it is 12%
    short. The muni names' TERM beta does level off: 0.50 at L = 1, 0.63-0.65 at 3-5,
    0.63-0.74 at 6-10. CREDIT moves by up to 0.17 per group from L = 3 to L = 5 (loan
    1.00 -> 1.17, hy 1.28 -> 1.37, multi 1.35 -> 1.43, muni 0.74 -> 0.75; the first build
    said "at most 0.10", which these same figures contradict). LOANS has no plateau at any
    L: outside the loan fund (JFR) its group medians wander between -0.20 and 0.73.
  * The per-factor review counts move with L. On the first validation book, between
    L = 1 and L = 3 the dates flagged moved by 7 to 12 of 24 for TERM, CREDIT and LOANS,
    and by 3 for MUNI [V: `analyse --plateau`, 2026-11-02; the reading is not committed,
    because it derives from the account's positions]. `analyse --plateau` prints the
    counts at L = 0 .. L + 2 beside the adopted row.

The team lead ruled on 2026-11-02: re-derive L properly, under a lead-calibrated null
declared before it is run, before the next reading. THE RULE above is that null. At the
commit that declared it DIMSON_LAGS was still 3, from the superseded first-gap rule. The
next commit, made after `derive` had run the rule, set it to the rule's output, 0. The rule
reads only the fit era's public prices, never a reading of any account. Each lag costs
estimation noise: at L = 3, 17 regressors on 252 sessions, about 15 sessions each.

THE WINDOW: THE SLEEVE'S OWN z_window
-------------------------------------
W = frozen `z_window` (252 sessions today, read through scripts/cef/spec.py at run time).
  * It is the memory of the signal that chose the positions, so the readout reads the book
    through the same window as the signal that built it.
  * It is the framework's trailing-beta convention (PORTFOLIO_FRAMEWORK_2026-10-15 §3.1).
  * One year spans a full distribution and tax calendar, including munis' year-end.
  * A shorter window was tried for z and failed out of sample (the spec's z_window note).
`analyse --plateau` re-runs at W/2 and 2W (lags fixed) and at lags 0 .. L + 2 (window
fixed), and prints the factor P&L, by book and by group, and the per-factor review counts
beside the adopted row. That is a check for a plateau; nothing is chosen from it.

NO LOOKAHEAD (H7, asserted at run time)
---------------------------------------
The exposure on date t uses betas, orthogonalisation slopes and factor vols estimated on
the W sessions STRICTLY BEFORE t (the y rows), with lagged factor rows reaching L sessions
further back. `assert_strictly_before` raises `LookaheadError` if any row of either window
is dated t or later; it is an explicit raise, not an `assert`, so `python -O` cannot strip
it. The factor P&L of session t uses the exposure of the previous session (E(t-1) x f(t)),
with f(t) built from E(t-1)'s own slopes.

TOTAL RETURNS (H15)
-------------------
r_t = (1 + close_t / close_{t-1} - 1) * k_t - 1 + D_t / close_{t-1}, on yfinance's raw
`Close` and `Dividends`, where k is the split multiplier on an ex-split date: the harness's
own formula (`band_frontier.total_returns`), checked by the same split-basis guard
(`data_guards.guard_split_basis`). It does not use Yahoo's Adj Close for returns, because
Adj Close is re-based at every distribution and is not stable even between two fetches
(docs/REFERENCES.md §8, the byte-identity row). Adj Close is cached and cross-checked only.
A split and a distribution on one name-date raise, as in the harness. Yahoo reports no
capital-gains column for the CEFs; for an ETF a non-zero `Capital Gains` value raises,
because whether Yahoo also counts it in `Dividends` is not documented here [U].

The CEF closes and distributions come from the same vendor as data/cef/'s panels, so
`crosscheck` agreeing with those panels confirms the fetch, not the data (review 2026-11-02,
finding 6); every cross-check row now names its panel's vendor. docs/REFERENCES.md records
11 CRSP distributions missing from the yfinance distribution panel in 2005-2022 [S], three
of them large year-end specials (PFN 2012-12-26, PTY 2011-12-28, PCN 2012-12-26). The cache
lacks those three as well [V: cache read, 2026-11-02], so they enter `derive` as price
returns. Dropping the three name-days from derive's regressions leaves its lag counts and
the muni group's plateau table unchanged [V: re-run 2026-11-02]. All three fall years
before any 2025-26 window.

EXPOSURE, VOL CONTRIBUTION AND THE REVIEW RULE
----------------------------------------------
For held name i on date t, v_i = shares_i(t) x close_i(t), signed (a short is negative):
  E_k(t)     = sum_i v_i x beta_ik(t)                     dollars; beta = summed Dimson beta
  e_k(t)     = E_k(t) / equity(t)                         fraction of equity
  sigma_k(t) = sd of factor k's daily return on the window x sqrt(252)
  c_k(t)     = |e_k(t)| x sigma_k(t)                      ex-ante vol contribution
  t-stat     = E_k / SE(E_k), SE^2 = (v' S v) a_k' (X'X)^-1 a_k, the OLS identity for
               names that share one design X (S = the names' residual covariance, a_k
               selects factor k's lag columns). Homoskedastic OLS; read it as a guide.
The total factor vol is sqrt(e' Sigma_f e), with Sigma_f the window covariance of the
factors (diagonal on the window, by construction).

REVIEW RULE (proposed 2026-11-02, declared and committed BEFORE the first reading on any
account's positions; it is a proposal, and the team lead decides it). Provenance: the rule
landed in one commit with this module, its tests and its REFERENCES row (034f1df), so git
alone cannot show that it came first (review 2026-11-02, finding 5). File times show it as
far as they go: the first analyse run on the account's positions wrote its outputs 11 s
after that commit, and the only earlier analyse run used invented three-name positions
[V: file times, 2026-11-02]. Any change to the rule lands in a commit of its own, before
any reading made under it.
  On each date t, a factor k whose c_k(t) exceeds REVIEW_FRACTION x vol_target_annual x
  sizing_multiplier goes to the team lead's review (the multiplier since the team lead's
  ruling of 2026-11-10, THE LINE IS ON THE ACCOUNT'S SCALE, below). Both are read from the
  book's own frozen spec at run time.
  NOTHING IS EVER HEDGED, TRADED OR RESIZED AUTOMATICALLY. Without an equity figure for t
  the rule is UNMEASURED on t. It is never evaluated against a default capital.

How REVIEW_FRACTION = 0.10 was derived (H14: the rule re-measures e_k and sigma_k at run
time and reads the vol target from the spec; the 0.10 is a rule, not a measurement):
  * D4 (docs/BRIEF.md; .claude/rules/research-harness.md) tolerates a factor beta of at
    most 0.10 in a strategy at its vol target ("alpha only, beta tolerated only as
    residual", team lead, 2026-10-09). PORTFOLIO_FRAMEWORK_2026-10-15 §3.1 applies the
    same bar to the whole book.
  * A beta bar does not compare factors whose vols differ. In the fit era's 252-session
    windows the orthogonal factors' median vols are TERM 5.5%, CREDIT 5.8%, MUNI 2.0% and
    LOANS 2.7% a year [V: derive, 2026-11-02]: a MUNI beta of 0.10 carries about a third
    of the risk of a CREDIT beta of 0.10. So the bar is applied to
    each factor rescaled to the book's own vol target: beta x sigma_k / vol_target <= 0.10,
    which is c_k <= 0.10 x vol_target. For the account the book's own vol target is
    vol_target_annual x sizing_multiplier (team lead, 2026-11-10; below).
  * Read another way, a factor at the line explains 0.10^2 = 1% of the target variance on
    its own, or correlates 0.10 with a book at its target.
  * Beside it the readout prints D4's literal reading |e_k| > 0.10 and the exposure's t, so
    the team lead can see whether a flag is size or noise. Neither is part of the rule.

THE LINE IS ON THE ACCOUNT'S SCALE (team lead, 2026-11-10)
  The line is REVIEW_FRACTION x vol_target_annual x sizing_multiplier, each read at run
  time from the book's own frozen spec (the core's through scripts/cef/spec.py, C4's from
  ops/specs/c4_families.frozen.json). WHY: the spec's `_sizing_multiplier_note` says the
  account holds m x the unit book and that vol_target_annual stays on the unit book's
  scale, so the account's effective ex-ante target is vol_target_annual x m. This readout
  measures the account's real positions (its shares at its closes, over its equity), so
  its line belongs on that scale. Before the ruling the line sat on the unit book's scale,
  and a book running at its effective target read m times closer to the line than it was.
  WHAT MOVES: the line, and the REVIEW flags and review counts read against it. What does
  not: E, e, sigma, c, t, c/target and total/target (both still over vol_target_annual),
  the betas and the factor P&L. So the flag is c/target > REVIEW_FRACTION x m, and every
  output prints the line's three inputs beside it. The multiplier is parsed by
  `sizing_multiplier`, a COPY of src/deploy/registry.cef_sizing_multiplier, the runner's
  own parse: absent or null is the unit book (m = 1, what the runner then holds, not a
  default invented here), and a malformed value or a near-miss spelling of the key raises.
  It is a copy because this module imports nothing from src/ (the test of what it is not
  pins that); a test holds the two equal on valid, absent, null, malformed and misspelt
  inputs, as live_attribution's copy of data_books.c4_nav_symbols is held.

WHAT IT REFUSES (raises, naming what is missing; never a default)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  * a fetch as of today or later: yfinance serves today's bar intraday (REFERENCES §8);
  * a ticker whose rows are not exactly the NYSE sessions from its first row to the asof
    (`ops/schedule/nyse_calendar.py`), a duplicate row, a non-finite or non-positive close,
    a negative dividend, a non-zero ETF capital gain;
  * a held name or a factor ETF with a missing return anywhere in its window, or with fewer
    sessions than the window needs; a close missing on a positions date (for a held name,
    in the default strict mode; the report job's partial mode leaves it out, named: PARTIAL,
    below);
  * a split on a held name after the first positions date (the cached close would no
    longer match the share count), and a split the guard reads as already adjusted;
  * a positions file with a duplicate (date, symbol), a non-finite share count, a date
    that is not a cached session, or an equity column that holds a value that is not a
    plain number (e.g. "$100,000.00"), is empty on every row, is missing on some rows,
    differs within a date, or is not a finite positive number. A file without the column
    reads every rule cell as UNMEASURED;
  * a held symbol with no group in data/cef/cef_universe.csv;
  * any write under data/ (CLAUDE.md landmine 9), or of a file git could see in the
    repository that encloses the target (from a linked worktree, that can be the main
    checkout): the outputs carry the caller's positions, and this repository is public.

PARTIAL: THE REPORT JOB'S MODE (team lead, 2026-11-10)
----------------------------------------------------
The daily P&L job (scripts/ops/pnl_report.py) runs at 20:30 ET, and a held name's same-day
close is not always served by then (HYT lags, CLAUDE.md landmine 6). Before this ruling that
made the job's whole factor block UNMEASURED. Where it was enforced: `fetch_yf` raises when
a ticker's last row is not the asof session, `fetch_each` then drops every row of that
ticker into `failed`, and the job refused the block for any held name in `failed`; past the
fetch, `readout` raises on a missing close on a positions date and `fit_window` on a held
name with no price column or a missing return in its window. The ruling: read the held
names that have every input the computation needs, mark the block PARTIAL, and name the
rest. So, behind explicit parameters that every research path and the CLI leave at False:
  * `fetch_each(partial=True)` keeps a ticker that is not `required` and whose rows stop
    before the asof, with the rows it has, validated up to its own last session. A required
    ticker (a factor ETF) stays strict and raises.
  * `readout(partial=True)` reads each held name on each date it has every input for: a
    price history, a finite close on the date, and a finite return on every session of its
    beta window. A name without one is left out of that date's exposure, value, groups and
    betas, and recorded in `Readout.excluded` (date, symbol, shares, reason). So a name
    whose close is late only today is read on every earlier date and left out today; the
    factor P&L of today, E(yesterday) x f(today), keeps it. If no held name has its inputs
    on a date, `NoInputsError` (a ReadoutError) is raised: there is no book to read. A
    factor ETF's missing return still raises as in strict mode.
With both at False (the default) nothing above runs and the outputs are byte-identical to
the strict build's (the proof is in the commit that added this).

TWO BOOKS (team lead, 2026-11-09)
---------------------------------
The team lead ordered a daily report for both paper books. Everything above is the
core's (book "cef"). C4 (book "c4") is a set of equity, sector, covered-call,
preferred and multi-asset CEFs, so the core's four credit factors are the wrong set
for it. The ruling: a factor set designed for C4, EQUITY = SPY (the headline), TERM =
IEF, CREDIT = HYG, PREFERRED = PFF, orthogonalised by the same Gram-Schmidt in that
order (general to specific, as the core's), TERM, CREDIT and PREFERRED marked
indicative as the core's non-headline factors are, and the book read in the report
split by family (equity_domestic, equity_sector, equity_covered_call, preferred,
multi_asset; C4's spec's frozen.level_signal.family_of) as the core's is split muni
against taxable. C4's method is the core's: the same lag rule, declared in its own
commit before any C4 result is read; the rolling z_window sessions strictly before t;
the review line at REVIEW_FRACTION x C4's own vol_target_annual x C4's own
sizing_multiplier (the multiplier since 2026-11-10), each read from its spec at run time.
Zero trials, no counter moved. `FactorSet` holds what differs and the
functions take it, defaulting to the core's, so the core's outputs do not move; the
proof is a byte diff on a synthetic positions file before and after this change.
Until C4's lag rule has run, `factor_set("c4").dimson_lags` is None and `analyse
--book c4` raises naming the missing rule.

THE C4 LAG RULE (DECLARED 2026-11-09, ITS OWN COMMIT, BEFORE ANY C4 PRICE WAS FETCHED
OR ANY C4 RESULT READ; team lead, 2026-11-09: "the same lag rule", "fit rows only").
Nothing in this rule was computed on C4's data before the commit that declares it: no C4
price had been fetched, and the only C4 facts in sight were the frozen universe, the
family map and the vol target, all from the spec. It is the core's rule (THE RULE, above),
applied to C4's factors, and its counts are `lead_placebo_counts` and `placebo_lag_rule`,
the core's code, with C4's factor set. `derive --book c4` runs it; `derive_c4` holds it.
  Data      Total returns (`returns_panel`, the harness's formula, one difference: a
            yfinance split record the split-basis check reads as `adjusted`, meaning the
            cached close has no split-sized step because yfinance adjusts Close for splits
            after the fact, is not applied, and each such name-date is named in the output
            [C4's fit booked BTO, TYG, NXG and EMO at -75% to -80% when this was not
            handled; `data_guards.guard_split_basis`]. The core has no such name). Cut at
            FIT_END (2022-12-30) BEFORE anything is shifted, so no response, lag or lead
            is dated 2023 or later (H13; `lead_placebo_counts` raises if one is). Fetched
            keyless by `fetch --book c4`, tickers SPY, IEF, HYG, PFF and the frozen universe,
            FETCH_START (2010-01-01) to the asof session.
  Factors   C4's, orthogonalised once on the whole fit era in C4's order (module docstring,
            TWO BOOKS).
  Names     The frozen C4 universe (the 74 of ops/specs/c4_families.frozen.json, read at
            run time), each with the rule's model (K = DERIVE_MAX_LAG = 10, J = 19, HAC(5),
            5%) on every session where all of the name's return and the 120 factor rows it
            needs exist. A name enters the pair set only if that sample has at least
            C4_RULE_MIN_SESSIONS = 252 rows (one readout window; 121 regressors need
            room beyond them); fewer, it is excluded and named in the output. A
            name whose yfinance history fails the cache's validation (`validate_prices`), or
            that yfinance has no rows for, is excluded and named. A factor ETF's failure
            raises. The pairs are names x 4 factors, on whatever names remain: the output
            states the count; the counts are compared within that count, so the rule does
            not depend on 74 being reached. THE SAMPLE IS STATED IN THE OUTPUT (first and
            last rows, sessions per name).
  Model, counts, bound, decision, ties, gaps, censoring: exactly as THE RULE above,
            including that lag 0 must beat T and that every lag 1..K clearing T raises.
  OUTCOMES (H14: re-measured when `derive --book c4` runs, and what follows either way
            is fixed here). If the rule returns L = 0: C4_DIMSON_LAGS = 0, C4's report uses
            same-day betas, exactly as the core's does. If it returns L >= 1:
            C4_DIMSON_LAGS = L and C4's report uses the summed Dimson beta 0..L. If it raises
            (lag 0 does not beat the largest lead count, or every lag 1..K clears it, or fewer than
            one name qualifies), the rule has no answer: C4_DIMSON_LAGS stays None, C4's
            factor readout in the report is UNMEASURED naming the raise, and nothing defaults
            to the core's L or to 0; the team lead decides whether a new rule is declared.
            Whichever it is, the result lands in the commit that follows this one, with the
            counts, the cache hash and the sample, and the rule is not re-tuned after it runs.
  What is NOT re-derived for C4: K, J, the 5%, HAC(5), the maximum-of-leads bound and the
            stop-at-first-failure sequence are the core's own, kept by instruction; the
            core's risks (a) to (c) (lead counts that are not null draws, exchangeability,
            the 19 leads' correlation) apply unchanged, and the same caveat holds: an episode
            could set T. No diagnostics are run after the result: section 2b of the core's
            `derive` is the core's review, and C4's was not ordered.

THE C4 RULE'S RESULT: L = 2, so C4_DIMSON_LAGS = 2 [V: `derive --book c4`, run 2026-11-09 at
18:48 ET, one minute after the commit that declared the rule (d37a86d, 18:47:25 -0500), on
a keyless yfinance cache fetched after that commit (asof C4_RULE_CACHE_ASOF, fetched
2026-11-09T23:48:19Z, prices.parquet sha256 C4_RULE_CACHE_SHA256); output in
results/cef/C4_LAG_RULE_RESULT_2026-11-09.txt]. Sample: 72 of the 74 names, 288 pairs (NPFD
and RLTY excluded with 242 and 195 usable rows < 252); response rows 2010-01-20 .. 2022-12-02,
the last row whose lead-19 row is on or before FIT_END; 257 to 3,242 sessions per name;
three recorded splits read as `adjusted` and not applied (NXG 2020-06-15, EMO 2020-07-28,
and IGR 2026-09-08, after the fit era).

  T = 65, at lead 13. Lags 1 and 2 clear it (128, 83); lag 3's count is 41, not above 65, so the
  sequence stops at lag 3: L = 2. A lag-4-or-later count above T would not matter (the stop
  rule). Under THE RULE's outcome table above this makes C4's exposure the Dimson sum over
  lags 0..2. The caveats of the core's result apply unchanged and unexamined here (the
  lead counts as null draws, an episode inflating T): the rule was applied as declared and
  is not re-tuned; the team lead may ask for a different rule, declared first.
