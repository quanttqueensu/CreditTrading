"""Load a live-path file as it stood at BASE, for byte-for-byte no-op proofs.

WHY. C4 step 3 (results/cef/C4_DEPLOY_PLAN_2026-10-27.md §1 row 3) edits three
files on the core's live data path: scripts/cef/fetch_daily.py,
scripts/fetch_cef_distributions.py and quantt/collect/collect.py. The rule is
that with C4's options absent the core is unchanged, and the proof is the old
file and the new one run on the same fixtures, in the same process (so the same
pandas and pyarrow write the bytes), with every output compared. The old file
is read from git, not copied into the repo: a copy could drift from what was
released, git's object cannot. results/events/exdrift/noop_fetch_cef_distributions.py
did the same for that script's 2026-10-27 edit.

BASE is origin/main when step 3 was cut (PR #19). When a reviewed change to the
core path lands after it, the proofs that use this are re-based on that commit,
deliberately, in the same commit as the change: they pin "unchanged since BASE",
and a core change is exactly what they exist to catch. If git cannot produce the
file (no history, a shallow clone), the test FAILS saying so; it is never
skipped, because a skipped no-op proof reads as a passed one.
