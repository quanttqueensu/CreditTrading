"""Daily refresh of the credit CEF price and NAV panels.

Run after the US close. Appends only new dates, so it is safe to run repeatedly.

    python3 scripts/cef/fetch_daily.py                       # plain refresh
    python3 scripts/cef/fetch_daily.py --require-asof 2026-09-08 \
            --nav-fallback cefconnect --book ops/books/cef_discount_book.json

--require-asof D   exit 4 unless every deployed name has BOTH a close and a NAV
                   dated D after the refresh, naming the gaps. A row dated D
                   with no finite close is not a close (EMPTY ROWS below).
                   The session uses this so it trades on today's pair or not
                   at all. It checks the DATE only: Yahoo serves rows dated D
                   that carry D-1's NAV
                   (results/cef/LIVE_NAV_QUALITY_2026-10-12.md §5). The VALUE is
                   the session's stale-NAV gate's job (quantt/session/nav_gate.py),
                   which writes its CEFConnect replacements through
                   `merge_nav_fills` / `log_nav_fills` below.
--nav-fallback     for a deployed name whose NAV for D is not on yfinance, take
                   CEFConnect's dated row for D. Every such fill is printed and
                   appended to data/cef/nav_fallback_log.csv; the two sources
                   agree to the cent on every comparison made 2026-09-08.

A bar dated TODAY is dropped if the run starts before 16:05 local. yfinance
serves the partial session as a 'Close' (NZF 11.88 on 78k shares at 10:27 on
2026-09-08); written as a close it would put an intraday print in the panel
that the drop_duplicates(keep="last") below would overwrite only at the next
after-hours run.

NAV is the load-bearing input here -- the entire strategy is the gap between price
and NAV, so a stale or missing NAV silently turns the signal into noise. The
freshness of every fund's NAV is therefore checked and reported, and any fund
whose NAV has not updated in three business days is flagged so the sleeve can
drop it rather than trade on a stale number.

LOCKING (2026-09-29). Two things now run this script against the same two
panels: the trading session (`quantt/session/run.py`, step 1) and the nightly
data collector (`quantt/collect`, every 30 minutes). Each run READS both panels,
spends minutes fetching, then REPLACES them. `atomic_write` stops a reader
seeing half a file, but not two writers interleaving: run A reads, run B reads,
B writes its new rows, A writes its own copy -- and B's rows are gone, with no
error anywhere. So the whole read-modify-write runs under an exclusive
`fcntl.flock` on `data/cef/.fetch.lock`. A second run waits for it, at most
LOCK_WAIT_S, then exits 3 naming the lock rather than waiting forever: the
session has a cls cutoff and the collector has its next 30-minute slot, and
neither may be blocked indefinitely by a hung fetch. Exit 3 is a refusal to
refresh, never a partial write.

EMPTY ROWS (fix approved by the team lead 2026-10-28). When Yahoo's chart
response carries a dividend (or split) for a date with no bar, yfinance 0.2.66
emits a row for that date with every price NaN and volume 0: `safe_merge_dfs`
appends a "row of NaNs" for an out-of-range event (yfinance/utils.py:761-767),
`keepna=False` keeps any row whose only datum is that event
(scrapers/history.py:502-506), and Volume is then filled with 0
(scrapers/history.py:492). This script wrote such rows unchecked, and because
each run's row for a date replaces the last one, an empty row overwrote a good
bar. Measured 2026-10-28, read-only, on the laptop's cef_prices.parquet (to
2026-10-15) against its 2026-09-28 backup (cef_prices.parquet.pre-20261015.bak):
15 good 2026-09-15 bars had become empty rows -- BIT, HYT, JFR, MHD and MQY of
the live 13 among them -- and the panel held 65 empty-close rows against the
backup's 49, every one with volume 0. Bars four weeks old were emptied, so this
is not only a partial today. `--require-asof` counted such a row as the as-of
close.

Now (`merge_price_bars`): a fetched row with no close is never merged. It
cannot replace a bar that has a close, it is not written for a date the panel
lacks, and each one is printed as `NO CLOSE <ticker> <date> <why>`. A fetched
bar WITH a close does replace an empty panel row (the repair), printed as
`REPAIRED`; never the other way round. "No close" means the close is missing or
not finite (`has_close`), never volume 0: the panel holds 20 real zero-volume
days that carry a close (FCT 2026-08-10, 9.67), and an empty row's 0 is
yfinance's fill, not a measurement. Nothing is filled or invented; a name whose
only row for D is empty has no close for D and `--require-asof` refuses it.
These lines go to stdout, the record both callers already keep (the session and
the collector each store the last 40 lines), beside the ERR and CEFConnect lines.
With no empty rows the panel bytes are exactly what the old merge wrote
(scripts/cef/tests/test_fetch_daily_empty_rows.py).

EMPTY NAV ROWS (the second half of the same fix, approved by the team lead
2026-10-28; the reviewers of the price half found the NAV side unguarded). The
NAV is fetched by the same `history()` call on X<TK>X, and three places took
its rows unchecked: the NAV merge (an empty NAV would replace a good one, as an
empty bar did), the stale check (a fund was dated by its last fetched ROW, so an
empty row dated today would make a weeks-old NAV look fresh) and the
`--require-asof` NAV check (an empty row dated D counted as D's NAV, so the
CEFConnect fallback was never asked and the pair passed). Measured 2026-10-28,
read-only: the
laptop's cef_nav.parquet (to 2026-10-14) and its 2026-09-28 backup hold no NAV
that is not finite. Whether Yahoo ever attaches an event to a NAV symbol, which
is what makes yfinance emit the row, is not established [U]; this half is
ahead of an incident on the NAV panel, not behind one.

Now the price rules hold for the NAV exactly (`has_nav`, `merge_nav_rows`): a
fetched NAV that is missing or not finite is never merged and never replaces a
NAV (`NO NAV <ticker> <date> <why>`); a fetched NAV repairs an empty NAV row
(`NAV REPAIRED`); the stale check dates a fund by its last fetched row WITH a
NAV, and a fund whose fetched rows carry none is listed stale; and an empty row
dated D is not D's NAV, so `--require-asof` sends the name to the CEFConnect
fallback when it is asked for, as a missing row does, and otherwise refuses it.
A CEFConnect NAV that is not finite is not written either. With no empty rows
the panel bytes and the stale lines are exactly what they were (same test
file).

FOLLOW-UPS (independent review of the NAV half, 2026-10-28). (1) A usable NAV
is finite AND positive (`has_nav`), the session's own test: gate 5
(`quantt/session/run.py` `last_navs`), the stale-NAV gate (`panel_rows`) and its
CEFConnect reader (`read_cc`) all refuse a NAV of 0 or below. Before, a NAV of
0 dated D passed `--require-asof`, never went to the fallback and was written,
and gate 5 then refused the whole session; now it is an empty row like NaN.
(2) The stale age is counted to the ET date of this run (`today` below), not
the machine's: the VM runs in UTC, where from 20:00 ET (19:00 in winter) the
machine's date is already tomorrow and every fund read one business day older.
(3) A fund whose NAV fetch raised, or came back with no rows, was never put
through the stale check, and the closing line still said "all N NAV series
fresh". Such funds are now listed as UNCHECKED, by name and why, and are not
counted as fresh.

DATA BOOKS (C4 deployment plan step 3, DARK; team lead's fast-track 2026-10-28).
`--data-book` names whose panels to refresh; the book's directory, funds, NAV
symbols, lock and CEFConnect use come from its config (`resolve_data_book`,
`scripts/cef/data_books.py`).

  * none, or `cef`: THE CORE, exactly as at 29e5dc0 -- data/cef/, the price
    panel's own tickers, X<TK>X, the core lock, CEFConnect when asked for, the
    same lines and exit codes. Resolved at call time from this module's
    constants (PX_PATH, NAV_PATH, LOCK_PATH, FALLBACK_LOG), so everything that
    patches or imports them (the session's stale-NAV gate, the tests) sees no
    change. Proved byte for byte against 29e5dc0's file on fixtures
    (scripts/cef/tests/test_fetch_daily_books.py).
  * `c4`: data/cef_c4/ under its own lock data/cef_c4/.fetch.lock, so the
    core's refresh never waits on a 74-name fetch, nor the other way round. The
    74 frozen funds; each fund's NAV from the committed NAV-symbol map, the
    symbol the families panel the trial ran on was built from; every empty-row
    guard above unchanged. CEFConnect is DISABLED: `--nav-fallback cefconnect`
    raises `CefConnectDisabled` before the lock is taken or a panel is read
    (exit 2 from the command line). A panel holding a fund outside the 74, or
    a fund under another family, raises: a mis-seeded panel is refused, never
    fetched into. With `--book`, every deployed name must be one of the 74.
    THE SPIKE GUARD (plan row 3, `guard_closes`): after the write, the merged
    panel is scanned by `data_guards.guard_closes` over the fetched window
    (no split multipliers: yfinance's close is already split-adjusted; no
    rulings file yet). A split-like spike-and-revert bar there -- IGR's
    2026-07-29..08-11 shape, which cost the holdout -10.87% -- is printed as
    `SPIKE-REVERT` and the run exits 6. The panel is still written whole, as
    for exit 4: the fetch records what Yahoo served, and the exit code is the
    verdict a C4 session must refuse on. AN UNRULED SPIKE OUTRANKS AN INCOMPLETE
    PAIR: with both, the run exits 6, not 4, and prints both lines (release-check
    of 8b14298, 2026-11-02). Until then exit 4 outranked 6, and C4's book sets
    `data.missing_nav = "hold"`, under which gate 5 treats exit 4 at the final
    check as expected (quantt/session/gate.py missing_nav_hold): on any day one
    C4 NAV was late, the session decided and sent on a panel still holding the
    unruled bar, and nothing in the runner reads the SPIKE-REVERT line. Exit 6 is
    refused at every check. A caller still retries: a refused session is not a
    FAIL, and the next slot re-runs the refresh; the collector reads an exit 6
    whose output names INCOMPLETE_TAG as an unfinished step, not a done one. The
    core runs no spike guard, so its exits are what they always were.
