"""Copy the team's `data/` folder to and from the private R2 bucket, under `team-data/`.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
On 2026-10-26 the team lead asked for the analysts to have the desk's own `data/`
(about 3.8 GB) instead of each rebuilding it. It cannot go on GitHub: the
repository is public, most of `data/` is built from WRDS (CRSP, TRACE), whose
licence forbids publishing row-level data (`docs/TEAM.md` §5), and one folder alone
is over 3 GB. The analysts already hold read-only tokens for the private R2 bucket
(team lead, 2026-10-22, `docs/SYSTEM.md` §5), so the copy goes there, beside the
WRDS mirror, and they pull it with the token they have.

    python3 scripts/data/team_data.py status          # what the team copy holds, and when it was pushed
    python3 scripts/data/team_data.py pull            # analysts: download into your own data/
    python3 scripts/data/team_data.py push            # team lead: show what would upload
    python3 scripts/data/team_data.py push --go       # team lead: upload it

WHAT IT GUARANTEES
------------------
  * **A manifest is the contract.** `push` uploads every changed file, then
    `team-data/MANIFEST.json` LAST: each file's path, size and sha256, and when it
    was pushed. `pull` downloads only what the manifest lists and checks every
    file's sha256 before it moves it into place, so a push that died halfway, or a
    file someone replaced by hand, raises instead of landing silently.
  * **`pull` never overwrites a file of yours that differs** unless you pass
    `--overwrite`. It checks every conflict first and names them all, before it
    downloads anything. Never run it in a prod clone: the live book decides on
    `data/cef/` (`CLAUDE.md`, landmine 9).
  * **`pull` writes only under `data/`.** A manifest path that is absolute or climbs
    out with `..` raises.
  * **Backups are not shared**: any file with `.bak` in its name, and dotfiles.
  * **Credentials** come from the env file through `src.data.r2.load_config` (the
    same four `R2_*` variables, read with `dotenv_values`, never printed). `push`
    needs a key with write access; a read-only key fails at the first upload with
    AccessDenied, which is the expected answer for an analyst's token.

Remote files that are no longer in the manifest are left in the bucket and ignored
by `pull`; nothing here deletes from R2.
