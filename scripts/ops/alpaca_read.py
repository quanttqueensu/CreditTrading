"""A GET-only reader of one Alpaca paper account, for the nightly report jobs.

WHY A SECOND READER EXISTS (team lead, 2026-11-09)
--------------------------------------------------
The report job (`scripts/ops/pnl_report.py`, the daily P&L attribution and factor
readout of each paper book) has to read the account: the EOD equity series, the
FILL and FEE activities, the calendar, SIP daily bars and the corporate-action
records. The ruling for that job is that it reads the account with the broker
key from the VM's secret service at run time and "read-only code: a test pins
that no import path from the job reaches order-sending code"
(`scripts/ops/tests/test_report_no_order_path.py`).

`quantt/broker/alpaca.AlpacaClient` is the runner's client. It holds
`submit_order`, and it is imported by `quantt.session.run`. A report job that
imported it, even at function level, would have an import path to order code,
which the closure test forbids and the team lead ruled out. So this module is a
second reader, deliberately outside `quantt/broker` (it is not to be imported by
the runner either), with four properties:

  * GET ONLY. One HTTP verb, built in one place (`urllib_transport`), checked by a
    test against the request object it builds. There is no POST, PUT, PATCH or
    DELETE here, no order, no cancel and no replace, and no parameter that adds one.
  * PAPER ONLY. The two hosts are this module's own constants, compared with
    AlpacaClient's by a test. `_get` raises on any other base, and a redirect is never
    followed: urllib would re-send both key headers to whatever host a 3xx names
    (review, 2026-11-09), so `urllib_transport` refuses the hop and a 3xx comes back as
    an answer, for `_get`'s non-200 branch to raise on naming it. A host check on the
    first request only is not a paper-only guarantee.
  * KEYS FROM THE PROCESS ENVIRONMENT ONLY (`AlpacaReader.from_environment`):
    `ALPACA_<BOOK>_KEY_ID` / `_SECRET_KEY`, which systemd loads with
    `EnvironmentFile=` from the tmpfs file the secret service wrote
    (`install_vm --reports`, docs/RUNBOOK.md 8.11). This module opens no key file
    and no `config/.env`, and names no variable but those two. A missing key raises
    naming the variable; it never prints a value, and `_scrub` removes both values
    from every message `_get` builds. The one message `_scrub` could not reach is
    http.client's own, which quotes a header value that holds a line break, so a key
    that is not printable ASCII is refused in the constructor, naming only the variable
    (`MalformedCredential`; review, 2026-11-09).
  * EXACTLY THE READS ATTRIBUTION NEEDS (a test pins the public method list).

WHY ITS PARSING IS A COPY, AND WHY THAT IS SAFE
-----------------------------------------------
AlpacaClient's parsers carry most of this desk's Alpaca incident history in their
docstrings (the 20:00 New York stamp of a 1D point, the leading funding zeros, the
FILL type field, the corporate-action shape rules). They cannot be imported
(see above), and `quantt/broker/*` is the runner's and is not to be edited for
this. So the parsing here is a copy of that code, read for read, and
`scripts/ops/tests/test_alpaca_read.py` runs both clients on the SAME fixture
responses and requires equal parsed output, row for row, and equal raises on the
malformed shapes. That equality test is the licence for the copy: edit either side
and it fails. The copied docstrings are shortened to the reason and a pointer to
the original.

WHAT IT REFUSES (raises, naming what; never a default)
-------------------------------------------------------
Everything AlpacaClient refuses on these reads, and: a base URL that is not one of
the two hosts; a redirect; a key that is not in the environment or is not printable
ASCII; a page that does not advance.

This module is stdlib plus pandas (`fetch_bars` returns a frame, as
`scripts/rv/alpaca_daily.fetch_bars` does). It imports nothing from `quantt/`.
