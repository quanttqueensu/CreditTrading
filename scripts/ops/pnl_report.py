"""The daily P&L attribution and factor exposure report for one paper book (report only).

    python3 -m scripts.ops.pnl_report --book cef [--state-dir DIR] [--asof YYYY-MM-DD]

WHY THIS EXISTS (team lead, 2026-11-09)
---------------------------------------
Each book's P&L was explained by hand, session by session, from a laptop cache (the
10-30 loss that turned out to be muni NAVs under two shorts, `scripts/cef/
live_attribution.py`). The team lead ordered it as a daily VM job for BOTH paper books,
the core and C4: official P&L, hold split into NAV part and discount part, fill cost,
fees and distributions, then factor exposure against the review line. This is that job.
It runs on a timer (20:30 ET core, 20:35 ET C4), after the 20:00 EOD stamp and clear of
the 21:40 collect, through `install_vm --reports` (kind `pnl`, docs/RUNBOOK.md 8.12).

WHAT IT IS AND IS NOT
---------------------
A WRAPPER AND A READER. Every number is computed by `scripts/cef/live_attribution.py` and
`scripts/cef/exposure_readout.py` (imported, their rules unchanged) from the account's own
fills and Alpaca's EOD history; this module joins them into one report and writes
`<state>/reports/pnl/<asof>.{md,json}` (the JSON is what `risk_daily` reads) and nothing
outside that directory: its fetch cache is `_cache` there, yfinance's own SQLite caches are
kept in `_yf_cache` there (`_keep_yfinance_cache_under`), and a directory under data/ or
visible to git is refused before anything is read (`LA._refuse_data_dir`,
`LA._refuse_git_visible`), because the report holds the account's equity and P&L and this
repository is public. It holds no order code, no broker client and no key file: the
account is read through
`scripts/ops/alpaca_read.py` (HTTP GET only, keys from the process environment, which
systemd loads from the tmpfs file the secret service wrote). No import path reaches
order-sending code (scripts/ops/tests/test_report_no_order_path.py pins it).

REPORT ONLY. A breach of a factor review line appears in the report and sends NOTHING: this
module never pushes, never sets ACT, never calls `report_notify`, never halts or trades.
Report-only, zero trials, no counter moved.

WHAT IT REPORTS (per book)
--------------------------
One section for the session just closed and one cumulative from the book's first trade
(derived from the account's fills, never a date written here): official P&L (Alpaca EOD
history, the P&L of record, docs/SYSTEM.md section 5), hold split into NAV part and
discount part, fill cost, fees, distributions, then factor exposure at the last close
against the review line (REVIEW_FRACTION x vol_target_annual x sizing_multiplier, each from
the book's own spec; the multiplier since the team lead's ruling of 2026-11-10, because the
account holds m x the unit book and the readout measures the account) with the line's three
inputs printed beside it, the headline first and the by-family (C4) or muni/taxable (core)
split.

THE RECONCILIATION IS STILL THE POINT. Every session's rebuild (hold + fill + fees) must
equal the official EOD change to the cent. If it does not, the report says so loudly: the
overall status is UNRECONCILED, in the report's headline and on the job's stdout line, not
OK, with the line that names the session and the residual at the top; the JSON's
`reconciled` is false, and `risk_daily` shows WATCH; the attribution rows still print, for
diagnosis, and are labelled unreconciled. Since the team lead's ruling of 2026-11-10 the unit
also exits EXIT_UNRECONCILED (5), a failed unit, AFTER the report files are written (EXIT
CODES, below); before it the code was 0.

EXIT CODES (team lead, 2026-11-10; docs/RUNBOOK.md 8.12)
  0  EXIT_OK: the attribution ran and reconciled to the cent on every session. The factor
     block may still be PARTIAL or UNMEASURED: a factor gap costs only its own block.
  2  EXIT_REFUSED: refused before anything was read or written (no --state-dir and no
     QUANTT_STATE_DIR, or a state directory under data/ or visible to git).
  4  EXIT_INCOMPLETE: no broker read (no key, a failed read) or the attribution refused;
     the report says UNMEASURED and names why.
  5  EXIT_UNRECONCILED: the attribution ran, and on at least one session the rebuild
     (hold + fill + fees) does not equal Alpaca's official EOD change to the cent; the
     report's status is UNRECONCILED.
  A run that is both incomplete and unreconciled exits 4: with no broker read or a refused
  attribution nothing was reconciled, so the reconciliation is unknown, never "failed".
  1  is Python's own, an uncaught exception: a bug, and the report may not be written.
The report files are written before the process exits, whatever the code, so `risk_daily`
(its own timer, no dependency on this unit) reads the same JSON after a 4 or a 5 as after a
0. The rendered unit carries no SuccessExitStatus (install_vm's expected_report_service
admits none), so 4 and 5 both show as a failed unit in `systemctl`.

A MISSING INPUT IS UNMEASURED, NAMED, NEVER INFERRED (CLAUDE.md, no silent fallbacks).
  * no broker key, a failed broker read, or an attribution refusal: the report says
    UNMEASURED naming it and the unit exits non-zero (EXIT_INCOMPLETE), so a dead job is a
    failed unit, never a quiet green one. Its failure touches nothing else (no lock, no
    write under data/ or the clone, nothing another unit needs).
  * a fund's NAV not yet published at 20:30: the NAV/discount split is UNMEASURED for that
    name-day, named; hold, fill, fees and the reconciliation do not need NAV and stay
    complete; a cumulative NAV or discount part covers only sessions with every NAV, and
    says so. Each book's NAV symbols are its own (`live_attribution.nav_symbols`; C4's come
    from the committed map, 15 of its 74 funds not being on the core's X rule), so a gap
    here is a NAV the vendor has not served, never a symbol the wrong book's rule invented.
  * a distribution that cannot be resolved (the second source not current until the next
    session closes, `dist_score`): UNMEASURED, never zero.
  * a session with a modelled fee and no FEE row yet: "no FEE row yet (UNMEASURED)" in the
    fee check, never a measured 0.00 (the account's FEE rows post later than the trade date:
    `live_attribution`, FEES).
  * a held name without a same-day price (yfinance has not served it by 20:30; HYT lags,
    CLAUDE.md landmine 6) or without any price history: the factor block is PARTIAL, not
    UNMEASURED (team lead, 2026-11-10). It reads every other held name, names each one left
    out with the reason and their share of the book's gross, and labels every reading and
    REVIEW flag PARTIAL (`build_factor`). A factor ETF without its price, or no held name
    with its inputs: UNMEASURED, naming it. The attribution above it is unaffected either way.
    PARTIAL is about the as-of close only (independent review of PR #82, 2026-11-11): a name
    left out on an earlier date alone is a named note in the block's history, and the block
    is OK, because the job re-reads from the first trade every night and a fund yfinance no
    longer serves (merged, renamed) would otherwise keep every later night PARTIAL.
  * a book that holds nothing at the as-of close: the factor block is FLAT (independent
    review of PR #82, 2026-11-11). Nothing is held, so nothing is exposed; the block reads no
    exposure, no flag and no PARTIAL for that close, and never shows an earlier close's
    reading as the as-of one. FLAT is read only from a rebuild that reconciles: an
    unreconciled one makes the block UNMEASURED, naming why (team lead, 2026-11-11;
    `build_factor`), and risk_daily cross-checks every FLAT against the collector's account
    record for that close. Its history since the first trade is labelled with its dates;
    a history with no reading for a named reason is an UNMEASURED line in the FLAT block, and
    a bug, a LookaheadError or a failed price fetch while reading it makes the whole block
    UNMEASURED, as on a held night (second review of PR #82, 2026-11-11; `_factor_flat`).
  * a book whose Dimson lag rule has no answer: the factor block says UNMEASURED and why.

NO LOOKAHEAD (H7). The attribution uses fills and closes of the sessions it reports, the
factor exposure's betas come from the sessions strictly before each date
(`exposure_readout.window_rows` asserts it), and nothing here estimates anything.

    Exposures need each held name's price history (keyless yfinance). Never a default.

    PARTIAL, NOT UNMEASURED, FOR A HELD NAME WITHOUT ITS INPUTS (team lead, 2026-11-10). Until
    that ruling a held name yfinance had not served at 20:30 made the whole block UNMEASURED,
    because a book read without one of its names is a different book. Now the fetch keeps a
    late name's history (`fetch_each(partial=True)`) and `readout(partial=True)` reads each
    held name on every date it has every input for, leaving it out, named, where it does not
    (exposure_readout's module docstring, PARTIAL). The block is then PARTIAL: it lists each
    name left out at the last close with its reason and their share of the book's gross, and
    every reading and REVIEW flag on the partial book says PARTIAL. The share is read at the
    attribution's own closes (Alpaca's daily bars, the marks the rebuild reconciles to official
    equity), the one source here that has every held name's close on the date, so the
    numerator and denominator come from one source. The block stays UNMEASURED, as before,
    when a factor ETF has no price at the last close, or when on some date no held name has
    its inputs (there is no book to read).

    THE BLOCK IS READ AT THE ATTRIBUTION'S CLOSE, `res.asof`, AND AT NO OTHER (independent
    review of PR #82, 2026-11-11). `positions_frame` drops flat rows, so on a night the book
    holds nothing at that close the readout's last date is the previous HELD close. Before
    this review the block then printed that close's exposure and flags under status OK (a
    book flat on 2026-01-22 showed "MUNI ... REVIEW" read at 01-21, and risk_daily passed it
    as INFO), and when a name had also been left out on an earlier date the PARTIAL share
    was read against the as-of close's gross, 0, and raised, so the block said UNMEASURED
    with a ReadoutError. A flat close happens when a thin session flattens the core (the live
    sleeve flattens where the harness holds, E-2026-11-02-11). The backtest shows that often
    (E-2026-11-02-16, a backtest window, not the live record); the live book had not seen it
    as of 2026-11-02 ("There has been no thin session since 2026-09-28", E-2026-11-02-11).
    (Corrected on the second review of PR #82, 2026-11-11: this said "The core is flat on many
    thin sessions, so both were common", a backtest's frequency read as the live book's.) Now a
    book with no position at that close gets the FLAT block (`_factor_flat`): nothing to
    expose, no flag, no PARTIAL, its history labelled with its dates; and `_factor_report`
    refuses a readout whose last date is not that close.

    NEVER FLAT FROM A REBUILD THAT DOES NOT RECONCILE (team lead, 2026-11-11, on the second
    review of PR #82). FLAT is read from the fill rebuild alone (`res.name_day`'s positions at
    `res.asof`), so a closing fill the account never made (the review's phantom fill: the
    activities listed a sale of the whole book at the close, the equity series was built from
    the real fills) made the block FLAT and risk_daily INFO while the account held positions;
    the rebuild failed to reconcile that night, which was the only sign. `reconciled` is the
    attribution's own (`reconciliation`, every session from the first trade, to the cent), and
    anything but True means the rebuild's positions are not shown to be the account's: the
    block is then UNMEASURED, naming why, and no FLAT and no exposure is read. A held book on

    review and nothing missing. It is reached only from a rebuild that reconciles
    (`build_factor`), and risk_daily shows it as INFO only when the collector's account record
    for the same close holds no position either; WATCH when it holds any, UNMEASURED when it
    cannot be read (team lead, 2026-11-11; `risk_daily.factor_block`).

    It says so in its first line and reads nothing for that close: no exposure, no within or
    REVIEW flag, no PARTIAL, no share. Before this review the block showed the previous held
    close's exposure as the as-of reading, under status OK, dated but easy to miss. The
    history since the first trade (the review-flag counts and the factor P&L over the earlier
    held closes) is still read, and every line of it says which dates it covers; a name left
    out on one of those dates is the history's note and raises nothing. A history with no
    reading for a named reason (`_NotRead`: no held name with its inputs on an earlier date, or
    a book with no Dimson lag) is UNMEASURED in its own line, named, and leaves the as-of
    reading FLAT, because that reading needs no price: the book holds nothing.

    function caught every exception from the history read and kept the block FLAT, the report
    OK and risk_daily INFO, so a bug (a TypeError) and the runtime no-lookahead assertion
    (exposure_readout's LookaheadError, H7) passed as a history footnote on a flat night while
    the same failure on a held night made the block UNMEASURED, the report PARTIAL and
    risk_daily UNMEASURED; it also contradicted `_NotRead`, which says a bug propagates. Now
    only `_NotRead` is caught here, and anything else reaches `run_report`'s catch, which makes
    the block UNMEASURED as it does for a held book. That includes a yfinance outage: a factor
    ETF's failed fetch is re-raised by `fetch_each` (required tickers) as yfinance's own error,
    a ReadoutError ("yfinance returned no rows", yfinance 0.2.66 swallowing the transport
    error into an empty frame) or the transport's exception, never a `_NotRead`; so a flat
    night with yfinance down reads UNMEASURED, as a held night does, and is not a FLAT block
    with a history line. Widening `_NotRead` to cover it is the team lead's to rule."""
