"""The nightly risk report for one account: where it stands against every limit and stop.

    python3 -m scripts.ops.risk_daily --book cef [--state-dir DIR] [--asof YYYY-MM-DD]

WHY THIS EXISTS (team lead, 2026-11-08; design results/ops/AGENT_DESK_DESIGN_2026-11-03.md s2)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The stops exist (HALVE/KILL, trial 53's R1-R3, the core's 60-session rule, C4's
H11, trial 54's L1), but nothing read them on a schedule, and the evening check
that did lived in an open Claude session and ran three days late
(E-2026-11-08-03). So this runs on a VM timer after the decide, reads the files
the runner already wrote, and writes `<state>/reports/risk/<asof>.{md,json}`.

ONE ACCOUNT PER RUN. The design said "both accounts, one report"; the team lead's
2026-11-08 brief puts the output under `quantt_state/<book>/`, so each account gets
its own timer and report (`--book cef`, `--book c4`), and the diversification
block reads the other account's EOD series, read-only.

REPORT ONLY, AND A WRAPPER. Every number comes from an existing reader:
`quantt.session.drawdown` (imported, standard library only), `stops.py`'s printed
output (read from a file, never run here: its import closure reaches the broker
client), the runner's `eod_equity.csv`, `equity.csv`, `scores.csv`, `tca.csv`,
`plan.json`, `account.json`. It holds no broker client and imports nothing from
`quantt.broker` or `quantt.session.run` (scripts/ops/tests/test_report_no_order_path.py).
It never sends, cancels, arms, disarms, halts, or changes a spec or a book json.

A MISSING INPUT IS UNMEASURED AND NAMED, never inferred (CLAUDE.md). Blocks whose
inputs do not exist on the VM say so, with the exact command that would measure
them on a machine that has them: R1-R3 need `stops.py`'s fit series, the
attribution and factor readout read `<state>/reports/pnl/<asof>.json`, written by
the 20:30 job (`scripts/ops/pnl_report.py`, the team lead's report of 2026-11-09;
absent, they stay UNMEASURED and named). Those are stated gaps, not silent zeros.

THE DRAWDOWN READ. At 22:15 the as-of day's EOD row is not written yet, so
`drawdown.check` says UNMEASURED. The team lead ruled (2026-11-08) that this report
reads the freshest row: the as-of's own row if it exists, else D-1, labelled stale.
PR #55 adds that reader (`read_through`) to `drawdown.py`; it is not merged, so this
script calls `check` as it stands, uses the stale figure it already records, says
so on the line, and carries `FOLLOWUP_DRAWDOWN` (switch to `read_through` when #55
lands). A line breached on the newest row available is an ACT either way: a stop
that fires on D-1's close has fired.

SEVERITY (the design's table)
  INFO   inside every limit.
  WATCH  within a declared distance of a limit, or a data-QA flag on a held name.
  ACT    a pre-registered stop has fired. The team lead acts, by the route the
         trial names; this script writes the line and the revert, and nothing else.
Per-name concentration is reported and never raises severity (team lead,
2026-11-08: "measure it, change nothing").

PUSH: only on ACT (`scripts/ops/report_notify.py`). If no channel is configured the
report records `ACT: notification NOT delivered: <reason>` and the run exits
`EXIT_ACT_UNDELIVERED`, never silently.
