"""The trial registry: every trial's daily P&L series, stored where the inference
module can read it back.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (2026-10-27). The team lead ruled (docs/SYSTEM.md §5,
2026-10-27) that the paper's deflated-Sharpe bar gates "once trials store their
daily P&L series". That bar uses the Gumbel expected maximum, the effective N
and the measured cross-trial V[SR_n]. Until then, the desk's sqrt(2 ln N) on the
raw counter gates. Every input the paper's bar needs beyond the selected
strategy is a property of the whole SET of trials:

  - the effective number of independent trials: N_hat = rho_bar + (1 - rho_bar) M,
    which needs every trial's series to measure rho_bar
    (Bailey & López de Prado 2014, Appendix A.3);
  - the variance of Sharpe ratios across trials, V[SR_n];
  - the T x N P&L matrix that PBO/CSCV ranks (Bailey, Borwein, López de Prado &
    Zhu 2017).

A counter cannot supply any of them. López de Prado & Lewis (2019): "ignorance
of [E[K] and E[V[SR_k]]] makes it impossible to assess whether a discovery is
false" (3-0 verified, 2026-10-27). So every trial stores its series here, and
`bar_inputs` measures the inputs at run time (H14). It never reads them from a
document.

WHAT IS STORED WHERE
- `ledger.jsonl` (tracked) has one line per stored variant: counter, trial,
  variant, the commit and whether the tree was dirty, the series' first and
  last dates, n, gross Sharpe, skew, raw kurtosis, the series' sha256 and the
  parameters.
- `series/<counter>/<trial>/<variant>.parquet` (GITIGNORED) is the series
  itself. The repository is public, and an event book's daily P&L can be one
  CRSP-licensed security's return in all but name. E1's module rule is "never a
  row-level price or return" in a tracked file. The ledger's sha256 is the
  tracked commitment: `load` refuses a series whose bytes no longer match it.

A TRIAL HERE IS THE COUNTER'S TRIAL. `trial` must be `<COUNTER>-<n>`, where
1 <= n <= the counter's canonical count: the n-th trial the counter was
incremented for (for example "CEF-53"). That is what lets `bar_inputs` measure
coverage. A free-form id once let three labels for one trial cover a counter of
three (quant-reviewer, 2026-10-28). `variant` names each configuration that
trial evaluated. Clustering for the effective N runs over variants, because
correlated variants of one idea are the case it exists for.

Names are compared case-folded, and a series file is created exclusively. On a
case-insensitive volume, variant "wide" otherwise overwrote "Wide"'s file
(quant-reviewer, 2026-10-28).

    `coverage` compares the stored TRIALS with the counter's canonical count.
    The ruling is that the paper's bar gates "once trials store their daily
    P&L series". While some of the counter's trials have no stored series, the
    measured rho_bar and V[SR] describe only part of the search, so

    decision (DESK_METHOD §7 item 6).

    rho_bar is the mean off-diagonal correlation of the variants' P&L on their
    common sessions, as measured. n_effective floors it at 0 because
    effective_trials needs 0 <= rho <= 1. With one stored variant there is no
    correlation to measure: rho_bar and sr_var are None, never a stand-in.

    NEVER GATE ON n_effective AND sr_var AS RETURNED. They are raw: N counts the
    stored variants, and V is unfloored. On 2026-10-28 they put EVENTS' bar at an
    annualised 0.06. The team lead ruled the same day that the paper's bar uses

    V[SR] and the common T measured now, across one series per trial
    (`_judged_matrix`).

    WHY THIS EXISTS. `bar_inputs` hands back the raw N and V, and an agent that
    assembles the bar from them gets EVENTS' 0.06. This function is the one place
    the safeguarded bar is assembled. The loop and the statistician call it and

    with `n_effective`, to `inference.p_pass_dsr(bound="gumbel")` for a power
    figure on the same bar.

    `declared_n` is the N the trial's pre-registration declares, read from that
    record (H14), never typed as a literal. It raises ValueError below
    `minimum_declared_n`. Raises PaperBarRefused, naming the missing input, when:
    - the counter does not qualify (`paper_bar_may_gate` is False). Under the
      2026-10-27 ruling the desk's bar gates there;
    - a trial with several stored variants marks none, or several, as judged;
    - fewer than two trials are stored, so rho_bar and V[SR] are unmeasured.
    Coverage is read from the ledger lines (`_coverage`), so a stray variant on a
    window of its own cannot break the bar.
      The safeguards floor V but say nothing about an unmeasured rho.

    Which counters the ruling excludes is read from SYSTEM.md by the caller: on
    2026-10-28 that was CEF, which cannot qualify in any case (50 of its 52
    trials cannot be rebuilt). Returns sr0 per period and annualised at 252.
