ZERO TRIALS. REPORT ONLY. FIT PERIOD ONLY. No counter, spec or RESEARCH_STATE edit.
The team lead approved this measurement on 2026-10-28 (`docs/SYSTEM.md` §5, row
"Re-opens (3) and (4)": "A1: run the zero-trial live-book measurement"). It is
item 1 of §7 of `results/events/A1_CEF_ISSUANCE_GATE_2026-10-20.md`, built the way
`scripts/events/g6_corporate_action_shorts.py` measured tenders and mergers.

Nothing here opens a network connection (`ops.netguard` is installed first), reads a
credential, touches R2, or calls a broker. The A1 census is re-run from the cached
EDGAR indexes and CRSP extracts exactly as A1's reproducer runs it; a missing cache
raises, naming it. The CRSP check reads the same cached extracts.

WHY THE QUESTION
----------------
A1 found that 18.1% of the fit-period book's short name-days fell inside a deployed
name's programme window (A1 §5.4) and did not ask what they earned: its brief
excluded strategy P&L. Two stories predict opposite signs. (a) An at-the-market
programme runs only while the fund trades at a premium the sponsor can sell into,
so a window marks persistent excess demand: the z-score reads the premium as rich
and shorts into a price that demand keeps up. Shorts lose. (b) The sponsor's sales
cap and compress the premium (A1 §4: 6 of 7 lower 63 sessions on). Shorts gain.
The measurement does not pick between them in advance; it measures the sign.

WHAT IS FIXED BEFORE ANY RETURN IS READ (the code computes holdings-only quantities
first and records them before it builds a single P&L figure)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **The windows are A1's, not redefined.** `a1.census` on the caches, then exactly
   `a1.book_exposure`'s "programme_episode" selection: an EDGAR supplement episode
   of a deployed name, first supplement before 2023-01-01, at least
   `a1.PROGRAMME_MIN_SUPPLEMENTS` supplements, not classed `rights`; window = first
   supplement .. last supplement, cut at the fit panel's last session. The list is
   asserted equal to the one A1 committed (`a1_levels_2026-10-20.json`), and A1's
   two counts (all short name-days; those inside) are re-measured on this book and
   asserted equal to the committed ones. If either moves, the run stops.
2. **The book** is the live policy on the harness: `build_targets` on the price and
   NAV panels CUT AT 2022-12-30 before any computation (`source=`), `fit_only`,
   then `band_gross_capped(T, BAND_WIDTH, MAX_GROSS_STRESS)` from the frozen spec.
   Two return views, each labelled, never mixed:
   * TOTAL (H15): `total_returns`, whose distribution and split inputs are proved
     unchanged by a cut at 2022-12-30 (`assert_return_inputs_cut`);
   * PAPER: price returns, because Alpaca paper pays no distributions (CLAUDE.md
     landmine 1; the team lead's 2026-10-28 ruling makes paper's own P&L decide
     paper admission). A short pays the distribution in the first and not in the
     second, and the windows sit in high-distribution PIMCO funds.
3. **The unit.** A short name-day is (decision session t, name i) with H[t, i] < 0,
   t from the book's first live decision. Its P&L is H[t, i] * label(R)[t, i] =
   H[t, i] * R[t+2, i] (`harness.label`, H1): the position decided at t, filled at
   t+1's close, earning t+2. Summed over names that is `evaluate()`'s P&L moved back
   two rows (asserted). The two last decisions earn in 2023 and are dropped.
4. **Inside** means the window covers the DECISION session: first supplement <= t
   <= end. A filing dated t is public by 17:30 ET and the book decides in the
   evening (G6's alignment). The START is therefore causal. THE END AND THE
   PROGRAMME LABEL ARE NOT: the window ends at the episode's last supplement, and
   "programme" counts the episode's later filings (A1 §3: "an ex-post label, fit for
   description and not for trading"). Four of the seven windows end only because
   the fit period ends; their last supplements are 2024-26 EDGAR filings (dates, not
   prices). So the block below is an ex-post-window counterfactual, not a tradable
   rule; a tradable one would read the first supplement's cover (A1 §7 item 2).
5. **The statistic** (`inference.clustered_mean_diff`, SEs clustered by decision
   date, H6): mean P&L per short name-day inside and outside, and
   estimate = mean_outside - mean_inside, signed so that POSITIVE means the
   in-window shorts earn LESS (the question's direction). `read_result(estimate,
   se, meaningful, n_trials=1)`: one zero-trial conditioner measurement.
6. **`meaningful`**, declared here: the smallest difference that could pay for
   acting on it. Acting is the block (item 7); its cost is the turnover it adds,
   which is a property of holdings, not returns. So
       meaningful = 15bp x (turnover the block adds) / (in-window short name-days),
   in book return per name-day: the block's round-trip cost per name-day it
   blocks, at the grid's middle point. It is computed before any return. A block
   that adds no turnover has no cost hurdle and the run raises rather than invent one.

   **REVISION 1 (2026-10-28, after the first run and BEFORE any return was read).**
   The first run raised exactly there: the block REMOVES turnover (-10.0 turns over
   the window, about -1.05 a year). The book trades its in-window shorts inside the
   windows, at the band's edges and whenever the 1.80x gross ceiling rescales the
   book, and blocking them deletes those trades along with adding the entry and
   exit. So acting on the conditioner has no cost to clear, and the rule above
   cannot be formed. The run stopped before the first P&L line (the code computes
   holdings-only quantities first), so no return informed the replacement, which is
   the round-trip cost of the positions themselves, at the grid's middle point,
   per name-day they span:
       meaningful = 15bp x 2 x sum over spells of mean|w| / (in-window name-days),
   where a spell is a maximal run of consecutive decision sessions on which the name
   is held on that side inside a window. A per-name-day difference smaller than
   what one open and one close of the position costs, spread over its spell, cannot
   pay for any rule that trades on it. The unit-return split uses the same rule per
   unit of weight (15bp x 2 x spells / name-days), and each side (shorts; the long
   control) gets its own hurdle by the same rule. A1 §7's kill line is reported as
   computed; with negative added turnover it cannot bind, and the JSON says so.
7. **The block**, fixed and not tuned: G6's filter. Where the book would be short a
   name on a decision session inside its window, hold it flat
   (`H.where(~((H < 0) & M), 0.0)`); everything else is the book's. On exit it trades
   back to what the book holds. Because `evaluate` is linear, the block's daily
   gross P&L is the book's minus the in-window shorts' (asserted to 1e-15). Gross
   Sharpe and net at 5 / 15 / 30bp (the harness's `_row_stats`, the formula
   `report()` uses) for both, the change, and the H5 eras, on the window from the
   first session the book holds a position to 2022-12-30 (the sibling note
   `results/research/REOPEN_BOOK_NAVTENDER_E1_2026-10-28.md`'s window, so the book
   row can be checked against it). The comparison is not turnover-matched (H2): the
   block's added turnover IS its cost, charged in the net columns.
8. **The negative control** (H12): the same split on the book's LONGS. Story (a)
   says only shorts are hurt: in-window longs should do no worse (the price is held
   up). A long split as adverse as the short split says the effect is the names or
   the years, not the windows.
9. **Second methods.** (i) Within-date: on each decision date holding shorts both
   inside and outside, d_t = mean_outside(t) - mean_inside(t); its mean and
   Newey-West t (`inference.newey_west_t`). This removes every date effect, which
   matters because the windows sit in 2016-17 and 2018-22 only. (ii) An independent
   price source: the same positions priced on CRSP daily `ret` (total) and `retx`
   (price), pre-2023 by construction. Each must agree with the panel in sign; if
   they disagree, both are printed and neither is picked.
10. **Borrow** (H4), real money only: what the in-window shorts would have paid at
   IBKR's fee panel (`band_frontier.borrow_charge`), on the panel's own span only
   (2021-09-13 onward, cut at 2022-12-30). Paper charges none.

A1 §7's kill line, re-measured here (H14): if the in-window short P&L a year is
smaller than the block's added turnover x 5bp, the filter is immaterial.
