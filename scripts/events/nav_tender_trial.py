WHAT THIS IS
------------
`results/events/PREREG_NAV_TENDER_2026-10-19.md`, approved by the team lead on
2026-10-19 on all twelve defaults: EVENTS trial 2, bar N = 6. After a closed-end
fund announces an issuer tender at k% of NAV, buy it at the close of day 0 + 1,
tender every share, take P_final on the accepted fraction pi, sell the returned
residual at the close of F + 1, and short the asset-class ETF by the fund's
pre-event Dimson beta for the whole hold. Every rule here is the
pre-registration's; the section it comes from is cited beside it. Nothing is
swept and nothing is chosen with sight of a return.

NO NEW BACKTESTER (prereg §5.5)
-------------------------------
This module builds three matrices and hands them to existing code, unchanged:
  H  sessions x (one column per event, one per hedge ETF): decisions;
  R  CRSP total returns, with the tender session written into each event's
     column (§5.3);
  Q  the notional actually traded each session.
`band_frontier.evaluate(H, R)` applies H.shift(2) (decide t, fill at the close
of t + 1, earn t + 2), `band_frontier._stats(pnl, Q.abs().sum(axis=1))` gives
gross and the 5/15/30bp nets, `band_frontier.borrow_charge` the IBKR hedge
borrow, `validate._dsr` the bar, `w4_artifacts.nw_t/stationary_boot` and
`convert_issuance.cluster_t` the inference, `e1_etf_hedge_gate.windows/spans/
dimson` the hedge ratio, `event_store.observed_at/research_decision_time`
day 0, and the census's `parse_tender_offer/parse_tender_result/groups/
HEDGE_ETF` the terms. New code here: the event table, the readers the census
lacks (the final purchase price P_final, the pricing session, the final expiry,
terminations), the matrices, and the report.

THE ALIGNMENT, STATED (H7; asserted in `build_matrices` and `assert_alignment`)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* day 0 = the first NYSE session t whose 22:00 ET research decision time is at
  or after the day-0 filing's `observed_at` = max(the SEC header's
  ACCEPTANCE-DATETIME, 06:00 ET on EDGAR's filing date). The header, never the
  submissions API (prereg §4.2).
* H[t, event] = u for every decision row t in [day 0, F - 1] and 0 elsewhere.
  Under shift(2) the position is bought at the close of day 0 + 1, first earns
  on day 0 + 2, and is sold at the close of F + 1 (decided at F), so F + 1 is
  its last P&L session. The hedge column carries -beta * u on the same rows.
* pi and P_final enter R on the pricing session X_p only. No row of H depends
  on them; F depends on the outcome filing's `observed_at` alone (§5.3).
* beta uses fund and ETF returns on spans that end before day 0 - 42 valid
  sessions (`e1_etf_hedge_gate.windows`), asserted before day 0.
* The fit reader is `crsp_events.daily`, which cannot return a 2023 row; the
  holdout reader is a separate function that refuses to run until the fit
  verdict is committed (prereg §4.4 DG-NT-3, §7).

STAGE 0 AND THE RULINGS BLOCK (`.claude/skills/prereg/SKILL.md` §4b)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Stage 0 writes a flag table (`results/events/nav_tender/stage0_flags_<date>.csv`,
keys check, ticker, date) and the trial calls `data_guards.require_stage0_rulings`
before it forms ANY P&L, fit or holdout. A flag nobody must answer is not a
check: C4's IGR bars were flagged and never ruled, and cost -10.87% of capital.
The 20% unread-outcome gate (§4.3) halts before any return exists; so does a
missing input. Each halt raises `Stage0Halt` naming what the team lead must do.

LICENSING AND THE PUBLIC REPOSITORY
-----------------------------------
CRSP is licensed: tracked outputs carry aggregates and EDGAR facts only. Per-event
P&L, prices, permnos and betas go to `results/events/nav_tender/_cache_trial/`
(gitignored by `results/**/_cache_*`).
