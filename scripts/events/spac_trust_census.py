"""SPAC trust-value census: a ZERO-TRIAL look at buying SPAC common below trust and redeeming at trust.

WHY THIS EXISTS (team lead, special-situations sprint, job 4 of 6, 2026-10-15)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A SPAC holds its IPO money in a trust account; a public holder can redeem each
share for its pro-rata slice of the trust at a business-combination vote, at an
extension vote, or when the SPAC liquidates at its deadline. If the common
trades below that slice, a long position has a defined floor and needs no short
and no borrow. Before anyone spends a trial on it (EVENTS counter), the desk
needs the census this script builds: how many SPACs there are, which are
tradable at Alpaca, how far below trust they trade, what the terms imply as a
yield, how much can be bought, and whether Alpaca can redeem at all.

NO TRADE RETURN IS COMPUTED HERE. The historical section measures LEVELS only
(price and trust per share at one point in time) and only before 2023-01-01
(the desk's time holdout). Whether a position bought at that point was in fact
redeemed, and at what, is the trial, and is not read.

THE ROUTES, AND WHY
-------------------
EDGAR, all through `scripts/data/edgar_client.py` (rate limit, back-off, cache):

1. **Who is a SPAC.** SIC 6770 ("blank checks") is the SEC's code, but it is
   the code TODAY: a SPAC that completed its merger usually takes the
   operating company's SIC, so a SIC-6770 list alone would drop most completed
   deals (survivorship). Candidates are therefore the union of
     (a) every CIK whose SIC is 6770 today (the company browse, ~3,350 CIKs);
     (b) every CIK that filed a 424B4 (a final IPO prospectus) from 2014 on,
         from the quarterly full indexes (the route `fetch_edgar_events` uses).
   A candidate is a SPAC if its first 424B4 is dated 2010 or later and at
   least one of: SIC 6770 today; an 8-K item 5.06 ("Change in Shell Company
   Status") after that 424B4; or an XBRL balance sheet within three years of
   it on which assets held in trust are at least 90% of total assets (a
   trust-funded shell; no operating company looks like that). Which rule
   admitted each SPAC is a column, so the definition can be audited.
2. **Each company's filing history** comes from the SEC's nightly bulk
   `submissions.zip` and the XBRL facts from `companyfacts.zip`: ONE request
   each instead of ~6,000 per-company calls. The SEC's API page calls the bulk
   archives "the most efficient means to fetch large amounts of API data".
   A CIK that is not in the archive (registered after the nightly build) is
   fetched from the per-company API.
3. **Events**, dated from the forms (`spac_events`, which documents each rule):
   IPO (first 424B4), deal announced (first 425), deal completed (first 8-K
   with item 2.01 or 5.06, or a change-in-control 8-K beside a delisting when
   the deal used a new holding company), liquidated (a delisting or
   deregistration form with no completion and no periodic report after it),
   and extension votes (an 8-K with item 5.07, before any completion, whose
   text proposes to extend the deadline). Liquidations and extensions are
   confirmed by reading the 8-K text, not inferred from the form alone.

Alpaca (read-only GETs: `/v2/assets`, `/v2/stocks/bars`; NEVER an order
endpoint): which of today's live SPACs list a tradable common share, on which
exchange, and its dollar volume.

CRSP (R2, read-only; licensed, so its rows stay in gitignored `_cache_spac/`):
pre-2023 closing prices for the historical discount distribution, linked to
EDGAR by name and listing date (`link_crsp`).

WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED
-------------------
* The terms-implied yield is a yield TO THE STATED DEADLINE IF HELD AND
  REDEEMED AT THE TRUST VALUE LAST REPORTED. It is not a forecast: a SPAC can
  extend without offering redemption at the old deadline, can be delisted,
  and can pay out less than the 10-Q trust (taxes, dissolution expenses).
  Those risks are in the note, not in the number.
* Trust per share is the last 10-Q/10-K figure, NOT accrued to today: the
  headline discount is therefore conservative (the trust keeps earning).
  The `*_accrued`, `yield_total_*` and `spread_*` columns are a LABELLED
  MODEL (`accrued_terms`): the trust earning FRED's 3-month bill, gross of
  the taxes and withdrawals it pays out of interest. Never the headline.
* A SPAC whose deal vote has passed (`deal_vote_date`) has also passed the
  redemption deadline before it; its unredeemed shares ride the merger. It is
  kept in the CSV and out of the `redeemable_pool` every statistic uses
  (measured 2026-10-18: five such SPACs traded 13-52% below trust).

THE IBKR GATE (`--ibkr`, added 2026-10-19)
-----------------------------------------
Team lead ruling 2026-10-19: SPAC redemptions go through IBKR (opened as a
second broker, equities only), and the gate is re-run on IBKR's terms. The
`--ibkr` mode does NOT rebuild the census. It reads the census's committed
outputs (`LIVE_CSV`, `YEARS_CSV`, the 2026-10-15 snapshot) and two PUBLIC IBKR
files, and adds: which live SPACs IBKR lists (`ibkr_match`), the yield after
IBKR's commission and its USD 100 SPAC-redemption fee at a grid of ticket
sizes (`ibkr_net_terms`), the capacity that repays the fee, and the number of
elections a year (`ibkr_election_load`). It opens no EDGAR client, no broker
connection and reads no credentials. See `results/events/SPAC_IBKR_2026-10-19.md`.

#
# WHY THIS SECTION EXISTS. The 2026-10-15 census stopped at G-S1 because
# Alpaca does not document a SPAC-redemption election. The team lead ruled on
# 2026-10-19 that redemptions go through IBKR. IBKR's own FAQ "How do I request
# a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) redemption?" (read 2026-10-19,
# docs/REFERENCES.md §12ag) documents the channel (Client Portal, Corporate
# Actions Manager) and says "A SPAC redemption request is subjected to 100 USD
# processing fee". IBKR's fee table lists "All Other (Mandatory, Voluntary,
# With Options, etc) | Free" and, separately, DWAC "USD 100 per settled
# transaction". The two IBKR pages disagree on whether a voluntary election is
# free; the SPAC-specific FAQ is used (USD 100), and whether the DWAC fee is
# charged ON TOP is unknown, so it is a separate fee case (USD 200), never
# averaged in. Every fee below is re-read from IBKR before any trade.
