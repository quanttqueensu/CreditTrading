WHAT THIS IS
------------
The trial script `results/events/PREREG_E1_MERGER_PAIR_2026-10-19.md` names (§6.4, §14). EVENTS trial 1,
judged at N = 6 (decision 1). After an EDGAR-dated NAV-for-NAV merger announcement between two
listed CEFs: long the target, short the acquirer, $1 for $1, from the close of A+1 to completion
(or to the close after a failure is public). Muni deals decide (decision 2); every other segment
is reported beside them and never decides.

AMENDMENT 1 (team lead, 2026-10-19, before any E1 return): "ignore fees, just look at PnL".
Borrow is never in a verdict. f_max is computed and printed (stages 4 and 7) and decides
nothing; the four borrow schedules are printed in their own labelled columns. Stage 4's 15bp
execution-cost test and the 5 / 15 / 30bp grid stand (the coordinator's reading of "fees").

THE ORDER OF EVALUATION (PREREG §10), and what this script refuses
------------------------------------------------------------------
  0  data gates DG-E1-1..7, the counts, both identity checks, the quality screen, k, the
     cap's binding share. ANY gate failure is a HALT, referred to the team lead; no E1
     statistic is computed past it. `fit` refuses unless the committed Stage-0 record says
     STAGE 0: CLEAR and every Stage-0 flag has a recorded ruling (`require_stage0_rulings`,
     the house rule of 2026-10-19, `.claude/skills/prereg/SKILL.md` §4b).
  1  fit muni per deal (completed and failed): median > 60bp AND group-clustered t >= 2.0, else KILL D1
  2  control 1 (the same pair a year earlier): median < 1/2 x treatment, else KILL
  3  control 2 (a non-merging same-sponsor fund in place of the target): the same; HALT if
     fewer than 75% of fit muni deals have one
  4  the tradable sleeve's net at 15bp (event turnover) > 0, else KILL D2; f_max printed
  5  R-D4: alpha t >= 3.0 and every |summed beta| <= 0.10, else KILL D4
  6  the bar: validate._dsr at N = 6 > 0.95, else NEITHER
  7  the fit verdict, k and f_max are committed (by hand) before any holdout number exists
  8  the holdouts, opened once: name + time pooled; three signs > 0, else KILL D3
Every statistic of every stage is computed and printed whatever the verdict; the verdict is
the first failing rule in that order. The holdout can kill; it can never rescue.

ALIGNMENT (H1, H7), stated and asserted
---------------------------------------
* A filing dated A is public by 22:00 ET on A (EDGAR's acceptance rule moves a filing after
  17:30 to the next business day, REFERENCES §12z). The decision is the evening of A; the
  fill is the close of the target's first session after A (`merger_pairs._announcement_row`'s
  d_in); the first return earned is the session after the fill. In the harness the weight
  sits on the market session before the fill and `evaluate()` applies shift(2);
  `band_frontier.event_hold` RAISES if a leg's fill is not strictly after A.
* A completed deal earns through the payment date dlpdt: the target's delisting return is
  booked on the dlpdt row, the acquirer's own returns run to dlpdt, and the legs leave H two
  sessions before dlpdt so their last earned return is dlpdt's. A failed deal is decided out
  on the evening of the failure filing date F and closed at the close of F+1.
* Every estimate that a later stage uses (k, f_max, the cap) comes from the fit only, is
  written to the fit verdict file, and is read back -- never re-fitted -- by the holdout.
* The fit reader is `crsp_events.daily`, which cannot return a 2023+ row. The holdout reader
  (`holdout_daily`) refuses unless the fit verdict is committed and says the holdout opens.

RETURNS (H15): CRSP `ret`, a total return; the short pays its distributions inside it.
`evaluate()` sums with pandas' skipna, so before any P&L the held name-days are checked
(`hold_gaps`): each is a finite `ret`, a missing-price gap of <= 10 sessions that the next
`ret` spans (CRSP's convention, tested on these extracts by `merger_pairs.bridging_check`),
or a target's sessions between its last trade and the payment date that its delisting
return spans. Anything else excludes the deal, counted. Nothing is filled with zero.

PUBLIC REPOSITORY: CRSP is licensed. Tracked outputs carry aggregates, counts, CRSP-free
EDGAR facts (CIKs, accessions, quotes) and tickers with dates; never a row-level price or
return. Row-level files go to `results/events/e1/_cache_e1/` (gitignored).

IMPLEMENTATION READINGS (the pre-registration is silent; each is listed in the Stage 0 note for the
team lead to correct before Stage 1). RULED 2026-10-20: all twelve accepted as recommended
(team lead, "accept all recommended"; PREREG amendment 2; results/events/E1_RULINGS_FORM_2026-10-20.md):
  R1 identity check 1 compares to 1e-12 against the published per-deal values as re-computed
     by `merger_pairs.announcement_sample_edgar` in memory, and at the published file's own
     precision (%.8g, string-equal) against `merger_ann_sample_edgar.csv`; the published
     aggregates in the tracked `merger_ann_edgar_summary.json` must match exactly.
  R2 a sleeve leg's weight is 1/n_g, n_g = the group's PRICED deals in that sleeve's set.
  R3 control 1's window length is counted in target sessions: (d_in, dlstdt] for a completed
     deal, (d_in, F+1] for a failed one; it ends 252 target sessions before d_in.
  R4 control 2's ADV is the 63-session mean of price x volume ending the session before A,
     for the target and each candidate; a candidate whose CRSP name cannot be matched to an
     EDGAR CIK (so its merger filings cannot be checked) is not a candidate, and is counted.
  R5 eras assign a deal by its fill date d_in.
  R6 the conversion residual in the sleeve is |R_T(dlpdt) - R_A(dlpdt)| x the converted
     weight; per deal (buy and hold) it is |pair return|, so units are 2 + |pair|.
  R7 the Stage-0 rulings file is `results/events/e1/e1_stage0_rulings.csv`: the E1
     pre-registration declares none (it predates §4b), so the house template's path is used.
  R8 DG-E1-5 asks for MUB/IEF/HYG coverage to 2024-12-31, but the only declared CRSP reader
     that may read 2023+ rows is the holdout reader, after the fit verdict. No E1 statistic
     uses factor returns after 2022, so DG-E1-5 clears on coverage of the fit window.
  R9 control 2's candidates are not filtered for `cef_universe.csv` names or the spec's 13 (the
     pre-registration names no such filter). A universe name chosen as a control is a return on
     the 27-name set; E1 consumes that set at Stage 1 anyway (decision 3).
  R10 DG-E1-3's census keeps every merger episode no matched CRSP completion explains; the
     "both parties listed CEFs/BDCs" test is left to the reading, which alone names the
     counterparty, so open-end trusts' N-14 episodes are read and recorded as not_a_listed_pair.
  R11 control 2's holdout exclusion uses holdout deal windows from dates only, [A, exit + 1 day],
     wider than the traded window, so no holdout price is read before the fit verdict.
  R12 stage 8 opens after any committed fit verdict except a HALT; after a KILL or NEITHER it is
     report-only and the verdict stays the fit's (`holdout_opens`). Until the 2026-10-20 ruling
     `holdout` refused after any non-pass.
