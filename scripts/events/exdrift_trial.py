WHAT THIS IS
------------
The pre-registration is `results/events/PREREG_EXDATE_DRIFT_2026-10-26.md`, approved by the team
lead on 2026-10-27 with every recommended answer of its §14: part (b) is EVENTS trial 3, judged
at N = 7; part (a) is withdrawn on power before any data step. Part (b) shorts each eligible fund
at the close of its ex-date e and covers at the close of e+3, against H-E, the equal-weight
basket of the other universe funds with no ex-date declared at e-1 in [e+1, e+8] (§4). The test
set is the 17 credit CEFs (the spec's 13 plus NAD, NEA, NVG, NZF), 2023-01-01 to the last panel
date (§5). This file is the trial script §4.5 names. It holds Stage 0 (§8) now; the later stages
are stubs that refuse until Stage 0 clears, and are written, reviewed and run after it.

WHAT STAGE 0 MAY READ, AND WHAT IT MAY NOT
------------------------------------------
* 2023-01-01 ON: DATES, COUNTS, PRESENCE AND FLAGS ONLY. No 2023+ return, P&L, price change or
  NAV change is computed, printed or written. The test set is opened exactly once, later, by
  `open`, and not by Stage 0. Concretely:
  - ex-dates and amounts (not returns; the brief allows them) from the refreshed distribution
    panel, and the second source's ex, record and declaration dates and amounts;
  - the session calendar (`date, ticker` of the price panel);
  - PRESENCE of a close, a NAV and a volume, turned into booleans as soon as they are read
    (`_present`), and two equality tests: volume == 0 and NAV(D) == NAV(D-1) (DG-X4, DG-X5);
  - the spike-and-revert bar guard (`data_guards.split_like_spikes`), which forms close and
    NAV ratios INSIDE data_guards to classify a bar. Only its flag keys (ticker, first bar,
    run end, revert date, split factor) leave `bar_guard_flags`; its ratio columns are dropped
    unread. The split-basis guard takes returns as input, so it is NOT run at Stage 0. Its one
    test-window split is classified from the factor alone (`split_basis_class`: undecidable). The
    opening does not apply split factors at all: r6's ±5-session mask (R1) removes those returns,
    so no factor is ever multiplied in.
* FIT, 2005-01-01 .. 2022-12-30: prices, NAVs and distributions, read through parquet filters
  at FIT_END so no later row is loaded, and asserted. Stage 0 computes on them only the identity
  gate (DG-X7): r6's statistic and H-E's per-event dispersion, both already published. No new
  fit statistic is formed: the brief for this run (2026-10-27) is "no P&L, no fit statistic
  beyond the identity gate". k and the cap-binding share (§4.4, DG-X7) form fit P&L, so they are
  left to `fit-k`, which runs only after every flag is ruled.
* THE 27 SEALED NAMES (`data/cef/cef_universe.csv` minus the 17) are never loaded: every panel
  read passes a parquet filter `ticker in NAMES`, and `_only_names` asserts it on every frame.

DG-X2 AND ALPACA'S DECLARATION DATE (2026-10-28). The announcements endpoint's `declaration_date`
is tested before it is used: every verified sponsor notice (`NOTICES`, quotes re-found offline)
is compared with it, and the weekdays from it to the record date are printed. PIMCO's own release
of 2025-10-01 contradicts it (Alpaca: 2025-10-12), and it sits 1-3 weekdays before the record date
on almost every record, so it is derived, not observed. DG-X2 then FAILS with one class flag
(`X2_source_invalid`), and the per-event "declared late" test is printed, never flagged: a flag
raised on an invalid field would ask for rulings on dates nobody declared.

THE BLOCK. `require_stage0_clear` calls `data_guards.require_stage0_rulings` on the committed
flag table and the rulings file, and then reads the committed Stage-0 record. `fit-k` needs the
first; `open` needs both and a committed k. Each refuses, naming what is missing.

IMPLEMENTATION READINGS the pre-registration does not settle. Each is a flag (`R1`..`R9`) in the
flag table, so the team lead rules on it like any other; the text is `READINGS` below.

Environment: `compute.use_numexpr` is off at import (DG-X8, `scripts/events/numexpr_fault.py`).
Tests: `scripts/events/tests/test_exdrift_trial.py` (synthetic data only).
