"""NAV-for-NAV CEF/BDC merger pairs, 2010-22: the repo re-run of SCALING §7.1 row 1.

    python3 scripts/events/merger_pairs.py          # writes results/events/merger_*.csv|json

ZERO TRIALS. DESCRIPTIVE ONLY. This is not a harness backtest (no shift(2)
policy, no turnover matching, no cost grid): it re-measures the descriptive
event statistics an agent printed on 2026-10-09 from scratch code that was then
deleted, so a pre-registration can cite a figure a script in the repo produces
(`results/cef/RESEARCH_PLAN_2026-10-09.md` §0, item 0.9). Nothing here may be
read as the E1 trial.

WHAT IS MEASURED (the original method, rebuilt; every change is listed below)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Events: CRSP delistings 2010-01-01..2022-12-31 of share-code 14/44 securities
(CEFs, BDCs) with a merger code (dlstcd 2xx). Target holders of a stock-for-
stock CEF merger receive acquirer shares at the closing NAV ratio, so

  r_final  = dlamt / |P_A(dlpdt)|   CRSP values the consideration at the
             acquirer's price on the payment date, so this backs out the shares
             of acquirer per target share (checked against filed ratios by the
             2026-10-09 agent: GGM 1.123347 vs 1.12334682, GPM 0.527929 vs
             0.52792920 [V, agent]; re-printed here for those deals);
  spread_k = r_final * P_A(t0) / P_T(t0) - 1 at t0 = k target trading days
             before the target's last day T; prices split-adjusted to the
             share units in force at T (target) and dlpdt (acquirer);
  pair_k   = long $1 target / short $1 acquirer, CRSP total return from the
             close of t0 to completion: target compounds `ret` over (t0, T] and
             then its delisting return `dlret`; acquirer compounds `ret` over
             (t0, dlpdt];
  ctrl_k   = the same pair over a window of the same length ending 252 target
             trading days before T (no deal pending, typically).

THE FIXED-OFFSET WINDOWS ARE EX POST. They are anchored on the completion date
and use the final ratio, which nobody knows at t0. They describe what the
spread did; they are not a tradable rule. The announcement-anchored sample
(`announcement_sample`) is the closest thing to an ex-ante entry, and it is the
figure the merger verdict turned on.

HOLDOUT. Every return statistic excludes any event whose target or acquirer is
in `data/cef/cef_universe.csv`. The 27-name comparison set was opened for
event trades by the team lead on 2026-10-09 (`docs/SYSTEM.md` §5), but the set
is CONSUMED by the first pre-registered test that computes returns on one of
its names, and this re-run is not that test. So returns stay off all 44 names,
as in the original. The universe is matched two ways and both are reported:
by ticker (the original) and by CRSP permno (`crsp_events.universe_permnos`,
which also catches a universe fund under an older ticker and keeps a recycled
ticker such as the 1990s BGT out). The G1c event COUNT (no returns) does
include events on the 27; see `g1c_counts`.

TIME HOLDOUT. `crsp_events.daily` returns no row on or after 2023-01-01. An
event whose payment date `dlpdt` falls in 2023 therefore has no acquirer price
at completion and drops out, and the drop is counted (`skip_reasons`).

CHANGES FROM THE 2026-10-09 SCRATCH CODE (each one visible in the output)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. MISSING DAILY RETURNS WERE TREATED AS ZERO (`ret.fillna(0)`; 20 cases in
   the original's pair legs). That is the silent fallback CLAUDE.md forbids.
   CRSP's convention is that the next valid `ret` after a missing price is
   measured from the last valid price, which, if true, makes compounding the
   valid returns exact as long as the window's first and last prices exist.
   `bridging_check` tests that convention on these extracts; `window_return`
   compounds across a gap only when the convention held at that gap and the
   window's boundary prices exist, and otherwise returns NaN, counted. Both the
   corrected figure and the original zero-fill figure are reported, labelled.
2. The universe flag is also matched by permno (see HOLDOUT).
3. An acquirer whose CRSP name is not in force on the delisting date (a fund
   created by the merger) was given its FIRST later name record, silently.
   It still is, but the row says so (`a_name_source`).
4. Events are grouped by acquirer PERMNO and completion date, not by acquirer
   ticker, so an acquirer with no CRSP name is not dropped from the group count
   by pandas' groupby (the original's grouping key could be None).
The split adjustment the agent added mid-run (FHI/FHO -> FHY reverse split had
produced -66% spreads) is kept.
