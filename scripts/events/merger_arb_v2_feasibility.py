"""Merger arbitrage, reconstructed so that what is left is alpha (D4): zero-trial feasibility.

    python3 scripts/events/merger_arb_v2_feasibility.py --today 2026-10-19
    python3 -m pytest scripts/events/tests/test_merger_arb_v2_feasibility.py

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`results/events/MERGER_ARB_AND_IBKR_2026-10-15.md` found that equity merger
arbitrage, held as an index of deals, fails D4: its return is the deal-spread
risk premium, a short index put (Mitchell & Pulvino 2001). The team lead's
ruling of 2026-10-19 asks for a reconstruction in which what remains is alpha.
The note `results/events/MERGER_ARB_V2_2026-10-19.md` argues the case; this
script produces every number in it.

The reconstruction the note carries forward (design MA-HZ) is Giglio & Shue's
(2014) event-time result: the hazard of deal COMPLETION is hump-shaped in the
weeks after announcement, holders under-react to the passage of time, and so
deals earn more in their high-hazard weeks than in their low-hazard weeks
WITH THE SAME FACTOR EXPOSURES (their Tables 5-7). A long-high / short-low
book inside the deal cross-section therefore differences out the deal premium
and its crash kink, which is what D4 asks for. Whether that book can be built,
and whether D4's alpha leg (t >= 3.0) can be reached on the data we have, are
the questions here. The angles the note kills are measured here too where a
number decides them (E1 at IBKR: borrow against the effect).

WHAT IT MUST NEVER DO
---------------------
Read a price or return of any security, or compute any statistic of a
strategy. That is the trial (EVENTS 0 -> 1). Everything here is a COUNT, a
DATE, a FEE, a FLAG, a dollar volume, or arithmetic on published numbers:

* deal counts, announcement and completion DATES (EDGAR, committed in
  `results/events/merger_arb/edgar_deals.csv` by `merger_arb_feasibility.py`);
* the weekly hazard of completion, a statistic of deal OUTCOME TIMING, from
  those dates (no price enters). Every deal is administratively censored at
  2022-12-30, so no 2023+ date informs it (H13);
* how many deals sit in each event-time window each month, and how often a
  window book would trade (turnover, from dates alone);
* today's pending deals: Alpaca flags, IBKR fees and dollar ADV as read on
  2026-10-18 by `merger_arb_feasibility.py` (committed CSV; true on that date);
* the IBKR FEE_RATE panel (`data/cef/cef_borrow_history.parquet`): a cost;
* power of D4's alpha leg at information ratios implied by the published
  test statistics (`scripts/xasset/slate_feasibility.py` owns the arithmetic).

Inputs are committed files and `data/` panels only. No network, no
credentials, no broker. Nothing is written to `data/` (landmine 9).

DEFINITIONS (stated once, here)
-------------------------------
* ANNOUNCEMENT `ann`: the date of the deal's announcement document as found
  by `merger_arb_feasibility.py` (8-K item 1.01, SC 14D9 or 425; `doc_date`),
  else `d0`, the first deal filing, an UPPER bound on the announcement.
* COMPLETION: the target's Form 25 / 25-NSE date (`delist_date`) when the
  deal is `completed` (a 25 within two years of its last anchor).
* FAILURE has no date in the census (a target 8-K item 1.02 is mostly credit
  agreements: `EDGAR_EVENTS_2026-10-12.md` §5). Two brackets, both reported:
  (A) a not-completed deal leaves the risk set at its last anchor `a1`, which
  is early; (B) it stays until week 52, which is late. A conclusion that holds
  under both is not an artefact of the missing date.
* UNIVERSES, fixed before any count: CASH_1STEP = consideration class `cash`,
  not a tender offer; STOCK_1STEP = class `stock`, not a tender offer, with an
  acquirer CIK; TENDER_CASH = class `cash` tender offers, the NEGATIVE CONTROL
  (Giglio & Shue exclude tender offers because their expiry date makes the
  passage of time salient: the mechanism cannot operate there). Deals whose
  target registered shares in the window (holdco moves, reverse mergers) or
  whose target is ambiguous are excluded and counted.
* WINDOWS: Giglio & Shue §6.1, cash: Low 1 = event weeks 1-10, High = 12-35,
  Low 2 = 37-45 (cutoffs 11 and 36, the cutoff week itself left out). Equity
  cutoffs 15 and 41; the paper prints no example, so STOCK uses 1-14 / 16-40 /
  42-50 by the same rule [U: by analogy]. Event week = floor(days/7) + 1.
