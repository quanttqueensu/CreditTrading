"""Zero-trial feasibility for the XASSET slate (RESEARCH_PLAN_2026-10-09 gate G8).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Gate G8 declares the five cross-asset tests X1-X5 in one pre-registration
(`results/xasset/PREREG_XASSET_SLATE_2026-10-12.md`) BEFORE any of them runs, so
the XASSET counter's N (and its sqrt(2 ln N) bar) is fixed in advance. Declaring
a test needs three facts that do not spend it:

1. does the repo hold every instrument the test names, from which date, with
   which interior gaps, and to which last date (stale is a form of wrong);
2. can the instrument be traded (and, where the test shorts it, shorted) at
   Alpaca today -- `shortable` changes daily (CLAUDE.md landmine 5), so every
   row carries the UTC time it was read and is true on that date only;
3. given each test's declared eligibility rule, how many fit-period years it
   has before the sealed 2023-01-01 holdout, and therefore what Sharpe the bar
   demands. That is arithmetic on the BAR, not on any return: the required
   Sharpe is found by inverting `scripts/cef/validate.py::_dsr` (the repo's only
   implementation of the deflated-Sharpe bar) at zero skew and normal kurtosis.

4. POWER (added 2026-10-12, with the team lead's rulings on the draft): at
   each test's fit length, the Sharpe it must show to pass, the Sharpe at which
   it would pass four times in five, and the probability of passing if the true
   Sharpe were the published one, or the published one cut by McLean and
   Pontiff's 58% post-publication decline (docs/REFERENCES.md §12b). This is
   arithmetic on published numbers, so a null result can be read: a test that
   cannot pass at its published Sharpe teaches little when it fails.

   REVISED 2026-10-13 (pre-registration revision 3, the adversarial review's
   fix 8). Three things were wrong with the first version:
   (a) T was the count of sessions after the first decision. Under shift(2)
       the first P&L is earned two sessions after the first decision, so T is
       now the P&L session count (`pnl_window`), the same T the trial passes
       to `_dsr`;
   (b) SE(annual SR) was 1/sqrt(years), a second, simpler copy of the
       sampling error. It is now `_dsr`'s own denominator at skew 0 and
       kurtosis 3 (`sr_se`, tested against `_dsr`'s z), so the bar and the
       error around it come from one function;
   (c) power was quoted only at the published Sharpe, which for X2 is HMM's
       in-sample 1.11 with no execution delay. Each test is now also powered
       at the draft's OWN expected range (EXPECTED_SR), and the published
       figure is printed as an upper reference.
   The D4 column now uses the BINDING regression window: where two R-D4
   regressions are declared (the test starts before HYG), the shorter one,
   from HYG's first return, is the one that must clear alpha t >= 3.
5. `--crsp`: each slate instrument's CRSP identity (`stocknames`, share code
   73), and in `dsf` its first and last date, row count, NULL-`ret` count,
   negative-`prc` count (no closing trade: CRSP stores minus the bid/ask
   average) and zero-volume count. These are coverage and quality COUNTS. No
   `ret` value is read into Python.
6. `--factors`: the AQR Time Series Momentum and Value and Momentum Everywhere
   factor files are reachable, with their column names and first and last month.
   The download goes to a temporary directory that is deleted, and no factor
   value is printed.

WHAT IT MUST NEVER DO
---------------------
Compute a strategy return, Sharpe, IC, turnover or any statistic of an X-test.
That would spend the trial before the slate is declared. It reads the
`ret_total` column only to find where it is non-missing (coverage). No return
is summed, averaged, signed or combined. `ret_total` values are never printed.

INPUTS (read-only; `data/` is what the live sleeve decides on, landmine 9)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
`data/rv/etf_panel.parquet` (34 tickers) and `data/rv/etf_ohlc_extended.parquet`
(60 tickers): in-house total return (close + distribution) / previous close - 1,
yfinance up to each fetcher's YF_LAST and Alpaca SIP bars after it
(docs/REFERENCES.md §8, fetchers `scripts/rv/stage_universe.py`,
`stage_ohlc_extended.py`). `data/etf_daily.parquet` (13 tickers; CRSP to
2024-12-31) is reported beside them as the second source where it exists.
The master session calendar is SPY's row set in `etf_panel` (SPY trades every
NYSE session from 1993-02-01).

OUTPUT
------
`results/xasset/slate_feasibility_<date>.csv`, one row per instrument: panel,
first and last non-missing `ret_total` date, interior gap count against the
master calendar, the CRSP-panel first date where it exists, and (with
`--alpaca`) name / status / tradable / shortable / easy_to_borrow / borrow_status /
exchange / marginable / fractionable with the UTC read time. It carries no
account identifier (the asset endpoint returns none). The per-test fit windows
and required Sharpes are printed.
