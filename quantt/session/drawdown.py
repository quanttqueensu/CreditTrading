"""The book's drawdown from its high-water mark, against the frozen spec's HALVE and KILL lines. Report mode only.

THE DEFECT (results/cef/PORTFOLIO_FRAMEWORK_2026-10-15.md §1 item 4 and §3.4)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The frozen spec has carried `risk.halve_drawdown` and `risk.kill_drawdown` since
v5, and the standing decision is to arm HALVE/KILL on broker-confirmed NAV (team
lead, 2026-09-08; docs/SYSTEM.md §5). On the Alpaca path nothing read either key,
and the runner never called any sleeve's `risk_check`. That sleeve method writes
0.18 and 0.12 as literals, and on an exception returns OK, a silent fallback.
Re-verified on 2026-10-19 at main 832aeaa: no `.py` under `quantt/`, `src/` or
`ops/` named either key, and nothing in the repository called `risk_check(`.
A survival line wired to nothing looks armed and is not. The deployed book's own
fit-window drawdown, 12.78% (2017-06 -> 2018-06; that note §1), would have
crossed the 12% HALVE line.

WHAT THIS IS (team lead, 2026-10-19: report mode first)
------------------------------------------------------
At every DECIDE the runner (quantt/session/run.py, step 2b) asks `check` for the
book's drawdown from its high-water mark on the official daily equity series,
compares it with the two lines, and records the result, together with what an
`on` mode WOULD do, in plan.json and the run record (`drawdown`). It also prints
it to the session log (`lines`). Report mode acts on nothing. ONE READER OF THE
STATUS RESTRICTS ON IT, and only while the core spec sets `below_min_names =
"trade_eligible"` (CEF trial 55, paper only; added 2026-11-03): run.py's K0
(`_thin_k0_stop`) lets the sleeve build a reduced 4-5 name book only when the
status is exactly OK, and on HALVE, KILL, UNMEASURED or anything else passes the
stop that takes today's flatten instead. K0 reads its OWN record of this check,
through the previous session's row (READ THROUGH, below; team lead's ruling
2026-11-03), not the `drawdown` record above, which is unchanged. Its one action
is today's rule: it never sizes up and never unlocks a send (the owner's term,
pinned by
quantt/session/tests/test_trade_eligible_runner.py, "no drawdown status can
increase gross"). With that key absent nothing reads the status, and the
orders, the plan_sha and plan.json are a check-off session's, byte for byte,
apart from the added `drawdown` record. The K0-K3 REPORT lines for that trial
are at the end of this module (`thin_stop_record`); they report and act on
nothing. quantt/session/tests/test_drawdown.py
proves it on the live spec, the real sleeve and the real panel. This is the
stale-NAV gate's report-mode design (quantt/session/nav_gate.py, 2026-10-13),
reused.

THE SERIES: `<state>/eod_equity.csv`, never `equity.csv`
-------------------------------------------------------
Team lead, 2026-10-19: Alpaca's end-of-day portfolio history
(`GET /v2/account/portfolio/history`, timeframe 1D) is the OFFICIAL daily P&L.
The collector writes it to `<state>/eod_equity.csv` and backfills it from
2026-09-28. Its header has `date`, `equity` and `change_usd`, possibly with
extra columns after them, and `change_usd` is empty on the first funded row.
This module reads two columns BY HEADER NAME, `date` (YYYY-MM-DD) and `equity`
(USD). `change_usd` and every other column are never read, so an empty cell or an
added column cannot break the check.
  * Why not `equity.csv`. Its rows are account SNAPSHOTS, taken by the collector
    after the close on after-hours marks. A snapshot can set a high-water mark
    the book never closed at, and every later drawdown would then be measured
    from a number that never existed at a close. The day-on-day changes differ
    materially: 2026-10-05 snapshot +$1,068.53 against Alpaca's EOD +$126.05,
    2026-10-16 +$242.56 against +$160.58 (figures as relayed from the session
    that built eod_equity.csv, 2026-10-19 [S]).
  * eod_equity.csv absent or unreadable -> UNMEASURED, naming the file. There is
    NEVER a fallback to equity.csv (CLAUDE.md: no silent fallbacks).
  * The snapshot is still SHOWN, as a second line explicitly labelled as
    snapshots and not the check's input (`snapshot` in the record). It never
    changes the status. It is there because, until eod_equity.csv ships (a
    hotfix release, week of 2026-10-19), it is the only equity history on the
    VM, and a reader should see both.

THE MEASURE
-----------
  HWM       the largest `equity` over every row dated on or before the as-of
            date (its first date is reported);
  drawdown  1 - (equity of the newest such row) / HWM, a fraction >= 0;
  STATUS    KILL if drawdown >= kill_drawdown, else HALVE if >= halve_drawdown,
            else OK. UNMEASURED when it cannot be measured (below).
NO LOOKAHEAD: the decide on as-of date D (evening of D, or the morning backstop
on D+1) may use the EOD equity of D and earlier, never later. Rows dated after D
are dropped before anything is computed, and that is asserted. The newest row
must BE D. A series that ends before D is UNMEASURED and says so; the stale
figures are still recorded, labelled with their own date. Whether the EOD row
for D exists by the 22:00 ET evening decide was open when this was built; report
mode measured it, and it does not: prod's 4 of 4 decides that carry the field
(as-of 10-28, 10-29, 10-30, 11-02) read UNMEASURED because eod_equity.csv's
newest row was D-1 (E-2026-11-03-41, the owner's finding, from prod's plan.json
records [S: not in this repository]). This default reading is unchanged by that
finding: what HALVE/KILL and any `on` mode read is the owning session's to rule.

READ THROUGH AN EARLIER SESSION (`check(..., read_through=d)`; CEF trial 55's K0
only, team lead's ruling 2026-11-03, E-2026-11-03-42). At 22:00 the EOD row for
the as-of D never exists yet (above), so a stop that needs an exact OK at the
evening decide would never pass: te4's K0 would flatten every reduced session and
the trial would never trade. The ruling: K0 reads the previous session's row,
labelled one session stale. With `read_through` set, the check is the same check
on the rows dated on or before `read_through`: the high-water mark over them, the
drawdown of the newest of them, the same status. The newest such row must BE
`read_through`; an older one, a missing or bad file, is UNMEASURED, exactly as an
as-of reading that ends early is. The reading carries `stale` = {row_date,
sessions}, its staleness in NYSE sessions after its row up to the as-of
(ops/schedule/nyse_calendar.py, the runner's own calendar; 1 when `read_through`
is the session before the as-of), and the record names `read_through`. No
lookahead: `read_through` after the as-of raises. Its cost, accepted by the
ruling: a loss on D is seen only at the next evening's decide. `read_through`
None (the default) is the reading above, byte for byte; only run.py's K0
(`_thin_k0_drawdown`) passes it, and HALVE/KILL's own record is unchanged.
The record also gives the worst drawdown in the series and the first date each
line was crossed. A STICKY `on` (below) would still be holding a line crossed
earlier, even after the book recovered above it.

THE LEVELS: the frozen spec, through the live path's own read
------------------------------------------------------------
`levels(spec)` reads `risk.halve_drawdown` and `risk.kill_drawdown` from the spec
dict that run.py's `load_spec` loaded (the live path reads the spec directly,
never through `scripts/`), never a literal. UNITS: a drawdown line is a FRACTION
of the high-water mark, in (0, 1), and halve < kill. A value >= 1 is a percent
written where a fraction belongs. That is the units trap that once made
`book_drawdown_suspend_pct` = 0.99 the tightest live limit in the book
(.claude/skills/spec-change). It is refused, never rescaled.

MODES (`MODES`; the book json's `risk.drawdown`; absent = off, run.drawdown_for)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  report   measure, record and print. It never blocks, never changes an order.
           An unexpected error is recorded as UNMEASURED with its type, and the
           session goes on (run.py `_drawdown`), as the stale-NAV gate's report
           mode does.
  on       NOT BUILT. Setting it raises; it needs the team lead's ruling.
What an `on` mode would do is recorded each session (`would_on`, `WOULD_ON`):
  HALVE       size every sleeve on half its budget, which halves the vol target,
              and keep that until the team lead records a review (STICKY: never
              restored automatically on recovery, framework §3.4, because
              re-levering on recovery whipsaws exactly when risk pays least);
  KILL        flatten every sleeve through the normal order path (every gate
              still applies), then write ops/HALT_cef.md; the team lead restarts.
              The halt must follow the flatten's send, or the halt gate would
              refuse the flatten;
  UNMEASURED  REFUSE THE DECIDE (a named `risk` refusal: nothing is sent, and
              verify reads the day as a MISSED FAIL).
WHY UNMEASURED SHOULD BLOCK UNDER `on` (the decision this docstring was asked to
make). A survival stop that fails open is the defect this module replaces: lines
that looked armed for months while nothing read them, and a `risk_check` that
returned OK on an exception. Failing closed costs one missed day. The desk
already shows a missed day loudly (MISSED FAIL in verify, orient and the status
line), and the cure is in our own hands (the collector backfills the file).
Failing open costs an unbounded drawdown, unseen. The trade-off accepted: a
refused day cannot reduce risk either. The alternative for the ruling is a
close-only day, which sends reductions only. That needs new order-path code, so
it was not chosen as the default.
In report mode UNMEASURED never blocks: that is the definition of report mode.

NOT HANDLED, AND WHY IT MATTERS BEFORE `on` ON REAL MONEY
---------------------------------------------------------
Deposits and withdrawals move equity without P&L. Alpaca paper has none, so the
HWM here is not flow-adjusted. A real-money `on` mode must adjust for flows, for
example from the account's CSD/CSW activities, before it can act.

H14: no number from a document is keyed on. The levels come from the frozen
spec, the equity from the broker's own series, both read at run time and
recorded with their source.

Standard library only at module level (pytest.ini; the send path never imports
`scripts/`).

# CEF TRIAL 55 ("te4"): the K0-K3 report lines
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# results/cef/PREREG_THIN_TRADE_ELIGIBLE_2026-11-03.md §6.3 requires, in the activation release,
# report lines for K0-K3 "in report mode and tested": "a stop that lives only in a document is
# a stop nobody reads". This is them. REPORT ONLY: nothing that trades reads any of it. K0's
# ACTION (a reduced build only on an exact OK) is quantt/session/run.py `_thin_k0_stop`, which
# reads this module's status; the line here reports whether that reading also KILLS the trial.
# Called only while the core spec sets `below_min_names = "trade_eligible"` (run.py
# `_thin_stops`), so with the key absent nothing here runs and plan.json has no `thin_stops`.
#
# READ THROUGH THE PREVIOUS SESSION (team lead's ruling 2026-11-03, E-2026-11-03-42). At the
# 22:00 decide the as-of's own EOD row never exists (E-2026-11-03-41), so K0 reads its status
# through the previous session's row, labelled one session stale (`check`'s `read_through`).
# The K1-K3 lines read eod_equity too, and as first built read the as-of's row, so every one
# of them would read UNMEASURED at 22:00 (the quant review). They are report only; they get
# the same read-through and the same label (`thin_stop_record`'s `read_through`, which run.py
# passes): K1 counts an earning day once its row is on or before the read-through date (the
# as-of's own earning day is counted at the next decide), and K2 and K3 divide the as-of
# close's positions by the read-through date's equity, one session stale (they are off by the
# ratio of the two equities, one session's return; labelled, never mixed with a fresh one).
# `read_through` None is the as-of reading, as first built.
# THE FRESHEST ROW (team lead's ruling 2026-11-04; the runner owner's review the same day, item
# 6). K0 reads the as-of's own row when it is there (the morning backstop), else D-1's
# (`run._thin_k0_drawdown`). The K1-K3 lines read through EXACTLY K0's reading date: run.py
# passes K0's `read_through`, and `thin_stop_record` refuses a K0 record that names another.
# So at the morning backstop K1 counts the as-of's own earning day and K2/K3 divide by the
# as-of's own equity (0 sessions stale, no note); at 22:00 they read D-1, labelled. K2 and K3
# always record `equity_date`, and an `equity_note` whenever it is not the as-of.
#
# Every input is passed in (the records, the series, the positions, the thresholds), so the
# function is tested on synthetic records; run.py does the reading.
#
# DEFINITIONS (§4.2, §6.3; compose.py's, where it has one):
#   reduced decision  §4.2: "a decide on which the sleeve's reduced build ran AND ITS TARGETS
#                     WERE SENT". A prior plan.json whose `thin_session.reduced` is true and
#                     whose `refusals` list is empty (the structured flag, never a reason
#                     string), whose targets were sent (`sent`, below; review fix F2 after
#                     7fcc2b7). The first build did not read the send, so a decided reduced plan
#                     whose late-market SEND was refused, dry or never ran counted, and K1
#                     compounded its earning day although the account held another book that
#                     session. A decided reduced plan that was NOT sent is not a reduced
#                     decision: it opens no episode, earns K1 nothing, and its close is not a
#                     reduced close for K2 or K3 (it neither breaks nor extends K3's run). One
#                     whose send cannot be established (`sent`'s UNMEASURED cases) makes the
#                     episode UNMEASURED, named, as an unreadable record does (READING BACK).
#   episode           reduced decisions fewer than THIN_EPISODE_GAP sessions apart; OPEN at this
#                     decide while the newest is fewer than THIN_EPISODE_GAP sessions back.
#   earning day       for a reduced decision whose session is s (filled at s's late window), the
#                     next session e; its return is eod_equity(e) / eod_equity(s) - 1, counted
#                     only once e is on or before the as-of date (no lookahead), or the
#                     read-through date when one is given.
#   K1                the maximum drawdown of the episode's earning-day returns compounded end
#                     to end from 1.0 at the episode's start; TRIPPED at or above the line.
#   K2, K3            at this decide, if the previous session's decision was reduced: the
#                     account's positions (after that session's fills) at the as-of closes,
#                     over eod_equity(as-of), or eod_equity(read-through date) when one is
#                     given (labelled). K2 the largest |name|, K3 |long - short|. TRIPPED
#                     above the line; K3 also above its run line on `thin_k3_run_sessions`
#                     reduced closes (the spec's `risk` block, required under the rule; a
#                     module constant until the runner owner's review 2026-11-04, item 9).
#                     K3's run counts reduced closes IN SEQUENCE (compose.py's
#                     `runs_above` over reduced decisions; a full session between them does not
#                     break it), read back from earlier plans' `thin_stops.K3.net` within the
#                     open episode only (§6.3's heading, "K1-K3 inside an episode"; the runner's
#                     owner confirmed it on 2026-11-04, recorded in the pre-registration's
#                     Approval section: the rule is the note's, and this implements it). A run
#                     that crossed two episodes, which compose.py would count, is not seen:
#                     episodes are 63 or more sessions apart. Each close is judged against
#                     today's line. WHICH RECORD HOLDS WHICH CLOSE: the decide for session X
#                     reads as-of previous(X), so plan(X).thin_stops.K3 judges the close of the
#                     session BEFORE X (its `session` field says so). The close before this
#                     decide's as-of is therefore in the as-of session's own plan, the newest
#                     record read back; the first build skipped it and counted one close too far
#                     back, so K3 tripped a close late on a true run and could trip on a broken
#                     one (both reviews of 7fcc2b7). Each earlier K3 counted must name the close
#                     it judged, or the run is UNMEASURED; so is a run still open where the
#                     walk stopped at a record it could not read.
#   send skip         the previous session's late-market SEND (send.json `skipped`, the run
#                     record's `skipped_at_send`) after a reduced decision. The send skips only
#                     orders that open or increase a short of a name no longer shortable
#                     (run.py `_send_planned`), so any entry is a lost short. Ruled 2026-11-03:
#                     accept it and label it; this is the label, and K3 watches the result.
#                     ONLY FROM A SEND THAT WENT (`_send_state`; review fix F3 after 7fcc2b7).
#                     `_send_planned` builds the skipped list BEFORE its gates, so a send that
#                     was then refused, or dry, writes the list and sends nothing; the first
#                     build labelled that a lost short. A send that did not go labels nothing
#                     (applies False, naming its exit): it is not a reduced decision (below).
#                     One whose outcome is not established leaves the session's record
#                     unmeasured, so whether the label applies reads UNMEASURED.
#   sent              (`_send_state`) whether a decision's targets went to the broker, read
#                     from the session's own records: plan.json `orders` / `plan_sha` /
#                     `execution`, send.json `plan_sha` / `exit` / `final` / `not_final`, and
#                     whether <D>/STARTED exists (run.py writes it before the first order of a
#                     set, and never otherwise; CLAUDE.md order-path rule 2); and, for a FAIL
#                     whose send.json records no order only, <D>/orders.jsonl and
#                     <D>/reconcile.json (run.py `_transmit`'s event log; verify.py's
#                     reconcile, `write_outputs`).
#                     WHAT run.py WRITES (read 2026-11-04, the runner owner's review item 10:
#                     te4 is PAPER ONLY and paper runs `late_market`, so this is the only case
#                     that will run). The late-market SEND (`_send_planned`) writes send.json on
#                     every outcome it reaches: `exit` (SENT, FAIL, DRY, REFUSED,
#                     NOTHING_TO_SEND), `plan_sha`, `skipped`, and `final` / `not_final`, which
#                     `_poll_final` fills ONLY for orders Alpaca accepted and the confirm read
#                     found: `final` {client_order_id: {status, filled, unfilled, ...}} for
#                     each that reached a final state by 30 s before the close, `not_final` the
#                     rest. A refused, dry or empty send writes `final` {} and `not_final` [].
#                     STARTED comes first, before any POST: a refusal never writes it. A FAIL
#                     comes from `_transmit` alone, after STARTED: a rejection (the rest still
#                     go), an ambiguous submit, a clock past the window, an order the confirm
#                     read did not find. The cls decide writes NO send.json: STARTED, then
#                     plan.json, then the transmit; its run record holds `sent`.
#                     THE RULE:
#                       * no orders: nothing needed sending, and the account already held the
#                         plan's targets when it was decided (a late-market decide with no
#                         orders exits NOTHING_TO_SEND and no send runs): SENT;
#                       * late market, SENT: STARTED exists AND send.json's `exit` is SENT
#                         (the runner's rule-2 marker plus the send record), AND its `final` /
#                         `not_final` record at least one of the plan's orders, AND at least
#                         one share filled, or an order is still working (below). Partially
#                         filled orders are sent: what filled is the account's, which K1-K3
#                         read from the broker's own figures;
#                       * late market, "sent, nothing filled" (NOTHING_FILLED; the runner
#                         owner's round-2 answer (b), 2026-11-05: sent requires at least one
#                         fill): a SENT (never a FAIL, whose `final` omits any order of unknown
#                         fate) where every order `final` records ended FINAL with 0 shares
#                         filled, canceled, expired or rejected (NO_FILL_STATES), and
#                         `not_final` is empty. The
#                         book did not change, so it is NOT a reduced decision: no episode,
#                         nothing for K1 to compound, no reduced close for K2/K3. A 0-share final
#                         under any other state (`replaced`: another order may have filled;
#                         `done_for_day`; a `filled` with 0) is UNMEASURED, named, as is a
#                         `final` entry without a whole-number `filled`. An order in `not_final`
#                         was still working 30 s before the close and may yet fill, so with one
#                         the send stays SENT, as the owner's first review defined it;
#                       * late market, a FAIL CLASSIFIED FROM `final`: STARTED exists, `exit`
#                         FAIL, and `final` / `not_final` record what went (at least one of the
#                         plan's orders): SENT IN PART, and the episode names it
#                         (`sent_in_part`). Part of the reduced book is held, and K2/K3 must see
#                         it: a rejected short leaves exactly the one-sided book K3 watches;
#                       * late market, NOT SENT: DRY, REFUSED or NOTHING_TO_SEND with no STARTED
#                         and nothing in `final` / `not_final`; or no send.json and no STARTED
#                         (no send ran in the window);
#                       * late market, NOT SENT, "not sent: 0 submissions proved by <records>"
#                         (the runner owner's round-2 answer (a), 2026-11-05): a FAIL whose
#                         `final` and `not_final` are empty, with STARTED, ONLY when the records
#                         prove positively that no POST was made (`_zero_submissions`): <D>'s
#                         orders.jsonl exists and holds ZERO `submit` events, only the events
#                         `_transmit` writes when it stops at the clock read that precedes
#                         every POST (PRE_POST_EVENTS), each naming one of the plan's orders;
#                         and, if <D>/reconcile.json is there (verify, after the close), it
#                         names no order of the session's client_order_id prefix and was
#                         written with STARTED. `_transmit` appends `submit` to orders.jsonl
#                         BEFORE each POST (fsynced, records.append_jsonl), so no `submit`
#                         means no POST; verify lists every order Alpaca holds with D's
#                         prefix, so its silence is the broker's;
#                       * late market, UNMEASURED, named, never a guess: a FAIL whose `final` and
#                         `not_final` are empty and whose zero submissions are NOT proved (an
#                         accepted POST the confirm read did not find, or an ambiguous submit,
#                         is in neither: orders may have gone): orders.jsonl missing, unreadable
#                         or holding a `submit`, a reconcile.json that cannot be read or names
#                         one of the session's orders; SENT or
#                         FAIL without STARTED; a STARTED beside a refused, dry, empty or missing
#                         send record (a later run's record over the send's, or a send that never
#                         wrote one); a send.json of another plan_sha; `final` or `not_final`
#                         missing or malformed, or naming an order the plan does not hold; an

#                       * cls (the decide is the send): SENT exactly when STARTED exists. A cls
#                         run writes no send.json, so STARTED is its only per-session record of
#                         the set; a set that began counts as sent, including one that failed
#                         part-way or whose every order was rejected (its run record, not read
#                         here, says what went). Not a mode te4 trades in: paper is late_market.
# READING BACK. Sessions are walked newest first from the one before this decide. A plan.json
# with no `thin_session` was decided with the key absent, when no reduced build could run, and
# ends the walk (the rule was off before it). A record that is there and cannot be read, a
# send whose outcome cannot be established (`sent`), or a session with a send.json or a
# STARTED and no plan.json (something went with no plan on record) makes the WHOLE episode
# UNMEASURED, named, and stops the walk: the walk cannot say what lies beyond it.
#   A NAMED GAP (the runner owner's review 2026-11-04, item 5) is a session with NO record at
#   all: no plan.json, no send.json, no STARTED (the runner did not run, or its decide failed
#   before writing a plan; nothing was sent, but whether its decision would have been a reduced
#   one is unknown). The walk records it in `gaps` and goes on. As first built a gap stopped
#   the walk and made every line UNMEASURED for up to 63 sessions, so one missed evening blinded
#   K0-K3 for three months. Now a gap makes UNMEASURED only the stops whose READ WINDOW holds it:
#     K0's episode state  the sessions fewer than THIN_EPISODE_GAP back: OPEN still reads OPEN
#                         when a known reduced decision lies in it (a gap can only add one); with
#                         none known, a gap there makes the state UNMEASURED, so K0 cannot read
#                         CLEAR on HALVE or KILL;
#     K1                  the episode's decisions whose earning day is on or before the
#                         read-through date: a gap there might be one whose day K1 would
#                         compound. A gap whose earning day comes later (the as-of session's,

    record that does not prove it, otherwise.

    WHY (the runner owner's round-2 answer (a), 2026-11-05). `final` / `not_final` hold only
    orders Alpaca accepted AND the confirm read found, so an empty pair cannot tell a send that
    stopped before its first POST from one whose POSTs went unconfirmed: until this answer every
    such FAIL read UNMEASURED, and with it the whole episode. The owner ruled it NOT SENT only on
    positive proof, and fail-closed on anything weaker:
      * <D>/orders.jsonl EXISTS and holds ZERO `submit` events. `_transmit` appends `submit`
        (fsynced: records.append_jsonl) BEFORE each POST, so a POST without one cannot happen.
        Missing, unreadable or empty, or holding a `submit`, it proves nothing. Every event it
        holds must be one `_transmit` writes before a POST (PRE_POST_EVENTS) naming one of the
        plan's orders: any other event with no `submit` is a log that contradicts itself.
      * <D>/reconcile.json, IF PRESENT (verify, after the close), names no order of the
        session's client_order_id prefix (`day["order_prefix"]`, `<cid_prefix>-<YYYYMMDD>-`:
        decide.client_order_id's scheme, the prefix gate 6 and verify match on). verify lists
        every order Alpaca holds with that prefix, into `orders` when orders.jsonl records it
        and into `problems` ("at Alpaca but not in orders.jsonl") when it does not, so a
        reconcile.json that never names the prefix is the broker's own word that no order of
        the session exists. Every string in it is searched, keys included, so a new field
        verify may add later cannot hide an order. ONE mention is not an order: verify's
        `read_orders_jsonl` refuses any event that has no `submit` line, so on exactly the
        session this proves it writes "orders.jsonl line <n>: event 'cutoff' for <cid>, which
        has no submit line" into `problems` (and the verdict line). That text, for an event
        this function has itself read from orders.jsonl at line <n>, is a statement about the
        local log, and is the only text not searched. A reconcile.json written without STARTED
        (`started` not true) is not the reconcile of this send. Absent, the proof rests on
        orders.jsonl, send.json and STARTED (verify has not run, or runs at 17:30 after a
        22:00 decide read the session back).
    The reader passes the two files as BYTES, parsed only here: a damaged orders.jsonl must
    not blind the walk on a session whose send.json already says what went."""
