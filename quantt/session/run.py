"""One trading session for one book: refresh, read, decide, gate, record, transmit, confirm.

This is the ONLY caller of `AlpacaClient.submit_order` in the repository
(docs/RUNNER.md module boundaries). The order of the steps is the contract in
RUNNER.md "The session, in order"; the reasons for the order are the incidents:

  1. refresh   `scripts/cef/fetch_daily.py --require-asof <prev trading day>`
               in a child process. The as-of date is the previous NYSE trading
               day by `ops/schedule/nyse_calendar.py` AND by Alpaca's
               `/v2/calendar`; if the two disagree the session raises rather
               than pick one (CLAUDE.md: two sources that disagree are reported,
               never averaged or silently chosen). A non-zero exit is a gate-5
               refusal: stale data never trades. The child is killed at
               the session's cls cutoff or after REFRESH_TIMEOUT_CAP_S,
               whichever is sooner, and a timeout is also a gate-5 refusal. Gate 5
               checks each name's CLOSE and NAV are dated as-of, so
               --skip-refresh cannot trade a name the sleeve silently dropped.
  1b. NAV gate only when the book json sets `data.stale_nav` (absent = off,
               the behaviour above unchanged; `report` records what `on` would
               do and changes nothing). Gate 5 checks a NAV's DATE; Yahoo serves
               rows dated D carrying an older NAV
               (results/cef/LIVE_NAV_QUALITY_2026-10-12.md §5). A name whose
               NAV(D) equals its previous NAV, or CEFConnect's NAV(D-1), is
               checked against CEFConnect's D: a stale copy is replaced (logged
               fallback), a genuine repeat kept. An UNVERIFIED name DEFERS the
               decide until the final pre-send check (a gate-5 `data` refusal:
               nothing decided, nothing marked, the next slot re-reads
               CEFConnect); from the final check it is HELD at its current
               shares, out of the cross-section (team lead 2026-10-13;
               `nav_gate.py`, "DEFERRAL AND THE ORDER PATH" below). After the
               sleeve has read the panel, `still_holds` checks it was the panel
               the gate certified, or the session FAILs.
  2. read      Alpaca clock, calendar, account, positions, closed orders, assets.
               Gate 6's order lists are read at step 4, not here.
  2b. drawdown only when the book json sets `risk.drawdown` (absent = off;
               `report` is the only mode built). The book's drawdown from its
               high-water mark on `<state>/eod_equity.csv` (Alpaca's EOD
               portfolio history, the official daily P&L) is compared with the
               frozen spec's risk.halve_drawdown / risk.kill_drawdown and
               recorded in plan.json and the log, with what an `on` mode would
               do. Report mode acts on nothing (`drawdown.py`; team lead
               2026-10-19). ONE READER RESTRICTS ON IT: under the core spec's
               `below_min_names = "trade_eligible"` (CEF trial 55, paper only),
               K0 builds a reduced book only when the status is exactly OK, and
               otherwise takes today's flatten (CEF TRIAL 55 block below). With
               that key absent nothing reads it.
  3. decide    the sleeve on the as-of date with the broker's holdings and
               `extras={"sleeve_nav": equity, "opening_session": bool}`, then
               `decide.decide` -> whole-share orders and `plan_sha`.
  3b. corporate actions only when the book json sets `corporate_actions.mode`
               (absent = off, the behaviour above unchanged). Alpaca paper
               processes no splits or mergers, so a held name's broker count
               can sit on a different basis from its as-of close. Every
               non-dividend action naming a held or targeted name inside its
               window is found (`corp_actions.py`, THE WINDOW): `report`
               records it and sends anyway; `halt` refuses with a gate-5 `data`
               refusal naming each event, and also refuses when the feed cannot
               be read. Run again at the late-market SEND on fresh reads (team
               lead 2026-10-28). On a combined book (MULTI-SLEEVE BOOKS below)
               the targets are the netted decision's AND every sleeve's own
               (`_plan_targets`), and the held names are still the broker's.
  4. gate      all nine (`gate.evaluate`), on a clock read AFTER the slow
               steps, never the one from the start. Gate 6's order lists
               (status=all since midnight before the as-of, and open) are the
               last broker read before that clock read (`_gate6_orders`; review
               2026-10-29); a failed read refuses. Any refusal: nothing is sent.
  5. record    `<state>/<date>/STARTED`, exclusively, BEFORE the first order
               (CLAUDE.md order-path rule 2).
  6. transmit  in `decide.transmit_sequence` order (running net kept near
               zero); the Alpaca clock re-read before every POST and the batch
               stopped at the cutoff. One POST per order, each attempt and response appended to
               orders.jsonl as it happens. ANY failure stops the batch: an
               `AmbiguousSubmit` is resolved by looking the id up, never by
               resending (a resend of an accepted order doubles it in the same
               auction), and a rejection or a bad echo stops the rest too,
               because the list that was approved is no longer the list that
               is going.
  7. confirm   every sent id is re-read from Alpaca by client_order_id; one
               missing or different is FAIL.

PAPER EXECUTION (team lead 2026-09-29; recorded exception to CLAUDE.md rule 3,
paper account only). When the book's json has `execution.mode = late_market`
the session runs in two phases:
  DECIDE  (evening 22:00-01:00 ET, or the morning backstop 06:00-15:15 ET):
          steps 1-4 as above, with every gate except dry-run, arming and clock;
          the plan is saved with `status: decided` and its plan_sha. Nothing is
          sent. Exit 6 PLANNED.
  SEND    (inside `late_window_et`, e.g. 15:52-15:58 ET): the SAVED plan is
          loaded and sent as market `day` orders -- never re-decided, because
          intraday equity moves the sizing, and what the team lead approved must
          be what goes. Positions must still equal the plan's "current" for
          every name; dry-run, arming (--approve, <D>/APPROVED, or AUTO_ARMED),
          halt, late clock, no-set, shortability, exposure and sanity are
          re-evaluated on fresh broker reads, and so is the corporate-action
          gate when the book sets it (step 3b): Alpaca can list an action
          effective on the session date only after the evening decide. Gate
          6's lists are read after all of those, just before the gate's clock
          read (step 4).
Why: paper runs no closing auction and under-fills `cls` (11 of 13 expired on
2026-09-29). Absent the key, the book runs as `cls` exactly as before.

DEFERRAL AND THE ORDER PATH (stale-NAV gate, `on` mode; team lead 2026-10-13).
A decide that finds an unverified NAV before the final pre-send check
(`nav_gate.final_check_at`: the session's calendar close minus 90 minutes, on
the session date; an evening run is never final) is REFUSED with a gate-5
`data` refusal naming the names. Nothing new was built around it, on purpose:
  * one plan per day: a refused plan is never `decided`, so `DECIDED` is not
    written and plan.json is overwritten by the next run, exactly as on an
    evening whose NAVs have not landed. The morning backstop's slots re-run
    refresh + gate and re-read CEFConnect; the first that verifies every name,
    or the first at or after the final check (holding what is still
    unverified), decides. A decided plan is never re-decided (unchanged).
  * STARTED / idempotency (CLAUDE.md order-path rule 2): untouched. A deferral
    happens at DECIDE, before any order and before STARTED could exist;
    `done_reason` and gate 6 still stop any second set for the auction.
  * plan_sha and approval: a refused plan cannot be approved (`approve_main`
    needs a decided plan) and cannot be sent (`load_decided_plan` needs one).
    The plan_sha that APPROVED or `--approve` binds to is the morning plan's,
    computed after the re-check; AUTO_ARMED sends whatever is decided, as now.
  * DRY_RUN: a deferral is a `data` refusal, so it is REFUSED, never DRY, and
    can never write DRY_DONE and idle the morning behind it.
  * late_market (CLAUDE.md order-path rule 3, the paper exception): the send
    window is unchanged; the final check sits 82 minutes before it opens, and
    the 15:00 slot is left to retry a final decide that failed. In `cls` mode
    the same refusal stops the evening send and the morning slots decide and
    send before the cls cutoff.
  * verify: a day still deferred at the send reads, from plan.json's refusal,
    `MISSED: ... [data] stale-NAV gate: ... deferred`: a FAIL, never a PASS.

MULTI-SLEEVE BOOKS (quantt/session/combine.py; DARK, team lead 2026-10-28).
`Deps.sleeves` is None for the released book json, and every step above runs
exactly as before (proved against de6e9c5: tests/test_combine_noop.py). It is
set only when every enabled entry of the book json's `sleeves[]` carries a
`risk_budget`. Then step 3 builds each sleeve from its own spec on its own
sleeve_nav and decides the NETTED book once; the closes, NAVs, assets, gate 9
and the send read the union of the sleeves' universes, each name's closes and
NAVs from its own sleeve's panel (PER-SLEEVE PANELS, below `refresh_subprocess`);
gate 5 acts per sleeve (`gate.gate_data_by_sleeve`); the stale-NAV gate's holds
go to the sleeve that owns the name; and plan.json gains `combine`, the
per-sleeve record. The book-level limits stay the book spec's, applied to the
netted orders by `fit_to_buying_power` and gate 8.

EACH SLEEVE'S OWN PANEL (C4 plan row 6A; DARK, 2026-10-29). Every panel read
-- the closes sized on, the NAV dates gate 5 and the missing-NAV hold check,
the pre-flight's history, the stale-NAV gate's file, the refresh -- is of the
panel the sleeve decides on (`spec_panel`, the sleeve's own `panel_paths()`).
For the released book that is `data/cef/`, by the same calls as before (proved
against 5e627ff: tests/test_panels_noop.py). A sleeve whose panel files are
absent, or whose universe its own panel does not cover, FAILs the decide naming
them; a panel this tree has no fetcher for is refused at step 1.

GATE 5'S MISSING-NAV HOLD (book json `data.missing_nav`; DARK, team lead
2026-10-29). `Deps.missing_nav` is None for the released book json, and gate 5
refuses the whole day when one name has no NAV dated the as-of date, exactly as
before (proved against bd87144: tests/test_missing_nav_hold.py). Why the key:
on 2026-10-22 PDO's 10-21 NAV never landed, the CEFConnect fallback that used
to fill such a gap has refused every scripted request since 10-21, and one
fund's NAV cost all 13 the day. With "hold" (`gate.missing_nav_hold`):
  * EVENING DECIDE and every morning slot BEFORE the final check (the
    stale-NAV gate's `nav_gate.final_check_at`, close - 90 min: 14:30 ET):
    REFUSED with today's gate-5 refusals plus one line saying the decide is
    deferred. Nothing is decided or marked; the next slot re-runs the refresh,
    and a NAV that lands meanwhile is simply used. The DEFERRAL AND THE ORDER
    PATH notes above apply unchanged.
  * AT OR AFTER THE FINAL CHECK: each name whose only fault is a NAV not dated
    as-of is HELD -- current shares, no order, out of the cross-section, never
    targeted to zero, never the cause of the sleeve's `min_names` flatten --
    through the stale-NAV gate's `nav_hold` extra; the other names decide. The
    stale-NAV gate runs on that exit-4 refresh too (`_nav_gate`).
  * Still refused at any hour, as today: a missing or stale CLOSE, a name with
    no NAV at all, a refresh failure other than INCOMPLETE, and more names
    without a NAV than `gate.max_missing_nav_holds` (n - min_names: 7 of 13).
  * THE AGE LIMIT (team lead 2026-10-29, a policy): a fund may be held for at
    most data.missing_nav_max_sessions consecutive sessions. At the final check
    after that, its NAV still not dated as-of, the day is REFUSED as without
    the key, the fund and its count named. The count is re-read from the prior
    sessions' plan.json (`missing_nav_streaks`); a missing or unreadable record
    refuses rather than counts as zero.
  * SHORT OF min_names (release-check of 6d42f4f): if, with the holds and the
    sleeve's own exclusions, fewer than `min_names` names are eligible on their
    signal (the sleeve's own count, tagged on its targets), the day is REFUSED
    as without the key, not decided as a whole-book hold that marks it DONE.
`missing_nav` in plan.json and the run record says what was missing, the
action, and what was held.

OPENING SESSION. True only when Alpaca shows no positions AND no order in the
account's history has ever filled. The sleeve is told explicitly (it never
infers it from a flat book: a failed day or a manual flatten also looks flat),
and it trades to full target instead of the band edge (team lead 2026-09-28).

EXIT CODES (distinct, for launchd logs and the operator):
    0  SENT             orders transmitted and every one confirmed at Alpaca
    3  NOTHING_TO_SEND  every gate passed and the order list is empty
    4  PREVIEW          --preview: the list was printed; never sends
    5  IDLE             --scheduled: not a slot, or this session is already done
    6  PLANNED          late-market execution: the plan is decided and saved; it
                        is sent in the late window (see "PAPER EXECUTION")
   10  DRY              DRY_RUN not "0" (and nothing else refused except arming)
   11  REFUSED          a gate refused; nothing sent
   20  FAIL             an error, a rejected/ambiguous submit, or a confirm miss

    Gate 6's Alpaca check is the only guard against a second runner, or a lost
    state directory, doubling the book (CLAUDE.md order-path rule 2), and
    `_transmit` never reads the orders again. Until this fix both send paths
    read the lists early and judged them at the gate, so they were as old as
    everything read in between: the asset GETs, the sleeve (at decide and
    `cls`), the closed-order history and every corporate-action page (the
    late send's gap widened by PR #20). One GET that exhausts its retries takes
    about 250 s (docs/RUNNER.md "Latency at the send"), and the send-budget
    gate refuses only once the clock passes the window's end minus the set's
    budget, so a stall that finished earlier sent on lists minutes old, blind
    to an order another runner placed meanwhile.

    So each path calls this after every other broker read, immediately before
    the gate's own clock read. The clock read stays AFTER it on purpose: the
    late-clock and send-budget gates (gate 4 for `cls`) then judge a time after
    this read too, as they do the corporate-action read, so a slow read here can
    only make them see a later time. Between these lists and the first POST
    stand only that clock GET, the pure gates, STARTED and `_transmit`'s clock
    GET before the POST.

    A FAILED READ REFUSES: gate 6 is handed `unread` and refuses, naming it
    (gate.gate_no_set_in_auction). A list that cannot be read is not an empty
    one, and no earlier read stands in for it: neither path reads the lists

# CEF TRIAL 55, "te4": below_min_names = "trade_eligible", PAPER ONLY
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# results/cef/PREREG_THIN_TRADE_ELIGIBLE_2026-11-03.md, approved by the team
# lead 2026-11-03 for paper only. On a session with fewer than `min_names`
# eligible funds but at least the floor, and no NAV hold, the core sleeve
# builds its book on the eligible funds instead of closing it (the sleeve's
# module docstring). The runner's part, every piece of it in the functions
# below, each with one call line in `run_session`:
#
#   * THE PAPER DECLARATION (§1.2, §10 Q14). The sleeve refuses to decide under
#     the key unless it was built with account="paper" and given
#     extras["thin_rule"]. The runner declares paper only when its broker
#     client's trading endpoint is exactly alpaca.PAPER_BASE (`thin_rule_for`).
#     Today the client cannot be anything else (AlpacaClient refuses another
#     endpoint), so the check exists for the day a live client is written.
#   * K0 (§1.3 item 5, §6.3; the owner's term 3). A reduced book is built only
#     when K0's drawdown record reads exactly OK. HALVE, KILL, UNMEASURED, a
#     stale series, a missing status: the stop goes to the sleeve and the
#     session takes today's flatten path. This is the FIRST ACTING READER of
#     quantt/session/drawdown.py's status, and it can only restrict: its one
#     action is today's rule, so no status can size up or unlock a send
#     (tests/test_trade_eligible_runner.py, the gross pin). K0'S RECORD IS ITS
#     OWN, READ THROUGH THE PREVIOUS SESSION (team lead's ruling 2026-11-03,
#     E-2026-11-03-42; `_thin_k0_drawdown`): at the 22:00 decide the as-of's
#     own EOD row never exists (E-2026-11-03-41: prod's 4 of 4 decides with the
#     field read UNMEASURED for it), so K0 as first built would have flattened
#     every reduced session. It reads the as-of's own row when it is there
#     (the morning backstop; ruling 2026-11-04: the freshest row, which can only
#     be stricter), else `drawdown.check(..., read_through=<the NYSE session
#     before the as-of>)`, labelled one session stale; an older row, a missing
#     or bad file reads UNMEASURED and the session flattens.
#     Step 2b's own record (HALVE/KILL's report) is unchanged and not read.
#   * THE GATE-7 FLATTEN (§7.5, §10 Q7). A reduced decision that loses a
#     short-opening order to gate 7 (decide's "not shortable today") is
#     re-decided flat: a 4-5 name book without its short leg is not the book the
#     trial scored (`_thin_gate7`).
#   * THE RECORD (§4.2; the owner's answer 6). plan.json and the run record gain
#     `thin_session` (and `thin_stops`, the K0-K3 report lines) ONLY when the key
#     is set; every key-absent field is byte-identical
#     (tests/test_trade_eligible_noop.py, against 0b1a2ef).
#   * NOT HERE, BY RULING: a short skipped at the late-market SEND (`_send_planned`
#     is unchanged; team lead, 2026-11-03, "accept it and label it"). The next
#     decide's `thin_stops.send_skip` reads that session's send.json and records it.
#
# With the key ABSENT `thin_rule_for` returns None and nothing below runs.

    (record dict, GateResult or None).

    It runs only on a refresh that passed (or was skipped): a failed refresh is
    gate 5's refusal and nothing is decided, so there is no NAV to certify. In
    act mode an error is the session's error (FAIL, the next slot retries):
    deciding without knowing which NAVs are stale is what the gate exists to
    stop. In report mode it changes nothing that trades, so an error is
    recorded as UNMEASURED and the session goes on, like the pre-flight.
    `record_csv(result)` is the gate's record; in act mode the gate writes it
    BEFORE it writes the panel (nav_gate.PanelGate.run, RECORD FIRST).

    A COMBINED BOOK ON AN INCOMPLETE REFRESH (combine.py; release-check of
    00ec423). There, exit 4 is not "nothing is decided": gate 5 holds the
    sleeves whose names are incomplete from the final check and the others
    DECIDE (`gate.gate_data_by_sleeve`), so skipping the gate sent those
    sleeves with no stale-NAV check while plan.json said gate 5 refused the
    day. So on a combined book the gate runs on exit 4, over every enabled
    sleeve's names, exactly as on exit 0. That is safe because the gate never
    acts on a name with no NAV dated as-of (`nav_gate.judge`: "not this
    gate's", gate 5's) and only ever rewrites a row dated as-of that exists;
    fetch_daily wrote the panel whole before it returned 4. The record says so
    (`refresh_exit`). The single-sleeve book is unchanged: any failed refresh
    there is gate 5's refusal of the day.

    THE MISSING-NAV HOLD (book json `data.missing_nav`, 2026-10-29) makes the
    single-sleeve book the same case: on exit 4 gate 5 holds the names without
    an as-of NAV from the final check and the rest DECIDE
    (`gate.missing_nav_hold`), so the gate runs on exit 4 there too, over every
    deployed name, for the same reason and with the same safety. Key absent:

    team lead 2026-10-29). The gate then clears that id only. This is the ONLY
    writer of the file, and it is run by the team lead or on the team lead's
    explicit instruction for that id (docs/RUNBOOK.md §6.1). It sends nothing:
    its one broker call is the read-only corporate-action read (`client`, in
    tests a fake; otherwise `AlpacaClient.from_environment`, keys from
    QUANTT_ENV_FILE, never printed).

    The entry keeps the feed row exactly as listed (`row`) and its type

    equals it and its type is unchanged (corp_actions.py, ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS).
    An UNRESOLVED row (docs/SYSTEM.md §5, team lead 2026-11-02 (unresolved corporate-action rows)) is acknowledged the same way, by its id or,
    when its id is null too, by the `row-sha256:` key the refusal names; the
    read never raises on such a row, so this works on it.

    Refuses (exit 11 REFUSED, the file untouched) unless: the id is one token

    an id already acknowledged is refused unless its row has since been
    revised, when the new entry replaces the old (kept as `supersedes`);
    and the feed, read for that record's names over that record's window (how
    the gate read it), lists the id. An unknown id is refused, so a typo
    cannot acknowledge nothing and leave the halt on unexplained. Writes with
    `records.write_json_atomic` (temp file, fsync, rename): a reader sees the
    old file or the new one, never half of either.

    overnight margin limits and the spec's stress cap (gate.buying_power_needed /
    gate.margin_limits / gate.stress_breach). Returns (orders, kept, binding
    constraint or None when nothing was scaled); `kept` is the share of the
    plan's traded notional (at the as-of closes) that the whole-share orders
    returned still trade (until 2026-10-13: the fractional plan's share).

    THE STRESS CAP (2026-10-09, 2026-10-11). Scaling reductions for neutrality
    (below) can leave more gross than the plan, so a fitted plan could break
    `gate.stress_breach` when the full plan did not. The cap is therefore one of
    the limits fitted to, read exactly as the gate reads it: against the lower
    of the equity the plan was SIZED on and `equity` (live at send), and only
    when the plan adds to the gross held now. So when equity has fallen since
    decide, a plan that adds gross is scaled down here, not refused at the gate.

    NOTHING FITS (2026-10-09 audit). If the book held now already breaks a
    limit and no scaling of the plan fixes that, the plan is returned UNSCALED,
    with the binding limit named. The gate then refuses it with its own
    sentence. Until 2026-10-09 this case raised a TypeError, and the session
    ended FAIL with a traceback instead of a refusal saying why. When only
    trading NOTHING fits (say, the book is above the stress cap and every order
    adds gross), the empty plan is returned, as the released grid did; the
    session then has nothing to send, and verify reads that as a missed day
    (verify._fit_emptied).

    WHY (team lead 2026-10-07, after the execution-desk review): refusing a plan
    that does not fit leaves yesterday's stale book; skipping names breaks
    neutrality arbitrarily.

    NEUTRALITY (review 2026-10-07): scaling only the openings is NOT neutral
    when a plan rotates a leg -- covering one short in full while opening the
    replacement short scaled ended +$20.9k net long in the review's case. So
    four factors are chosen -- opening buys, opening sells, reducing buys,
    reducing sells -- to (1) satisfy every limit, (2) keep the post-trade net
    closest to the full plan's post-trade net, (3) then keep the most traded
    notional. Reductions consume no buying power (Alpaca: they do not replenish
    it until executed, and they never use it), so they are scaled only when
    neutrality needs it. Called at DECIDE (as-of closes, evening account) and
    again at SEND on the live account, so a plan sitting on the limit at decide
    is not refused by a small adverse move by 15:52.

    EXACT (release-check 2026-10-11, the execution desk's finding; fixed
    2026-10-13). Until 2026-10-13 the four factors were searched on a 0.05 grid
    and refined on 0.01, ranked by the post-trade net's distance from the full
    plan's ROUNDED TO THE CENT, then by traded notional. A grid almost never
    lands on exact neutrality, so the ranking took whichever grid point came a
    few dollars closer, however much of the trade it cost. On the 2026-10-07
    plan with equity 0.5% lower at send, it kept 72.0% of the traded notional
    ($4.98 from the full plan's net); solved exactly, 98.8% fits at exactly the
    full plan's net, 98.7% in whole shares ($4.61 from it). It never broke a
    limit, so it cost trade, never safety (tests/test_fit.py). The same three
    objectives are now solved exactly, in closed form (`_fit_cuts`): with every
    order wholly opening or wholly reducing, each limit is linear in each
    bucket's factor, so the search is a linear program in two variables, solved
    on its boundary. The answer is rounded to whole shares as below and checked
    with the gate's own terms; only if float noise put it a hair over a limit
    is it solved again FIT_MARGIN_USD inside every limit.

    Flips are deferred (decide.FLIP_SAME_SESSION), so every order is wholly
    opening or wholly reducing; a leg-2 order is refused here rather than
    mis-sized. A name without a close is left to the gate's clean refusal, and
    so is an order that would cross zero against the positions held now or a
    second order in one name: decide never emits either, so at send they mean
    the positions moved, which the send refuses itself.

    WHOLE SHARES (release-check 2026-10-11). The fit is solved in fractions, so
    each order is then rounded to whole shares, in the direction that can only
    lower gross: an opening order DOWN, a reducing order UP (capped at its own
    quantity, so it never crosses zero). Until 2026-10-11 every order was
    floored, which covers LESS of a reducing order and leaves MORE gross than
    the fractional plan the search accepted. Both reviewers reproduced a fitted
    plan that gate 8 then refused on the very stress cap it was fitted to (about
    1 in 100 synthetic cases where the cap binds): a missed day, the 2026-10-09
    failure. Rounded this way, gross and the buying power needed are never above
    the fractional plan's, every limit here is monotone in them, and |position
    after| is never above the fractional plan's in any name (to 1e-9 of a share:
    a solution that is a whole number in exact arithmetic can land a hair under
    it in floats, and must not lose a share for that). The rounded plan is
    re-checked with the gate's own terms (`breach`); if it broke a limit anyway
    it would be returned unscaled for the gate to refuse, never sent above a
    limit.

    Before EVERY POST the Alpaca clock is read again and the batch stops if
    `in_window` says it is outside the send window (gate.in_send_window for
    `cls`; the late window for late-market): an order sent past 15:50 is rejected and
    one sent after 19:00 is queued into the next day's auction [V], and a POST
    retry or a slow response can carry a batch across either line. A clock read that fails also stops the batch -- an unmeasured
    time is not "before the cutoff".
