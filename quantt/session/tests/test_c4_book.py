"""C4's own book on the runner: BOOKS["c4"], its book json, its panel, its refresh, its state dir.

WHAT THIS PINS (C4 integration, 2026-10-29; deploy plan rows 6A, 8 and 11).
Each test fails on 35b429f (origin/main when c4-integrate was cut), which has
no BOOKS["c4"], no ops/books/c4_families_book.json, a refresh that refuses
every panel but the core's, no per-book state-dir rule and one distributions
panel:

  * BOOKS["c4"] resolves to C4's spec and book json, its own order-id prefix,
    and its own keys (ALPACA_C4_KEY_ID / _SECRET_KEY, alpaca_probe's naming);
  * the C4 book json validates through every reader the runner has, and says
    what the team lead ruled (no stale-NAV gate, the missing-NAV hold, report
    drawdown, late-market paper execution, one sleeve, its own $100k), with a
    note on every block;
  * C4's refresh is fetch_daily --data-book c4 (row 6A's interface, filled by
    step 3), and fetch_daily's own command line takes it;
  * a C4 session in DRY, built BY default_deps from the C4 book json on a
    fixture panel at data/cef_c4/, decides from that panel only: every parquet
    it opens is under data/cef_c4/, the core's data/cef/ files are absent and
    never asked for, the client is C4's, the plan is C4's 74, and the send at
    15:52 sends nothing;
  * a C4 run in another book's state directory is refused before anything is
    written there (session and verify);
  * the mirrored C4 paths agree: run.DATA_BOOK_DIRS, data_books.C4_DIR, the
    spec's panel_source and dist_score.PANELS.

The core is proved unchanged elsewhere (test_panels_noop.py, against cee16ad
and 35b429f). Hermetic: no network (netguard), no key file (the client factory
is faked), the panel generated under tmp_path, data/ never written.

# ------------------------------------- release-check of 8b14298: an unruled spike outranks the hold
#
# The REAL fetch_daily, on test_fetch_daily_books' C4 fixture (its `c4` fixture, imported
# below), gives the refresh's verdict: IGR's unruled spike-and-revert bar in the window and
# EVT's NAV for D (2026-09-29) late. The session then decides C4 at the FINAL CHECK of
# 2026-09-30 (as-of D) on test_c4_book's generated 74, with EVT's as-of NAV missing too:
# the same facts. Under data.missing_nav = "hold", gate 5 accepts an exit 4 there (EVT
# held, the rest decide), so before the fix (fetch_daily exited 4 over 6) C4 decided and
# would have sent on the unruled bar. Nothing in the runner reads the SPIKE-REVERT line.
