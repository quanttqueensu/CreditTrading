"""C4 under its book's corporate-action mode (`halt`), on a replica of the three unresolved rows of 2026-11-02.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-11-02). The core's release-check on 3478159 found three
market-wide rows in Alpaca's real corporate-action feed with a party symbol
missing, and under the team lead's 2026-11-02 unresolved-rows ruling each one
halts for every held fund, so the core shipped with its gate in `report`
(ops/books/cef_discount_book.json `_mode_report_note`). C4's book json keeps
`halt`. Whether that refuses C4's dry sessions is the team lead's decision to
make, and this measures it. It changes no mode.

THE REPLICA. The three rows as the core's gate recorded them in its preview of
session 2026-11-03 (as-of 2026-11-02, read 2026-11-02 23:34-00:14Z, the record's
`unresolved` list; [V] on that date only):

  db0847b7-9523-4b2f-afba-ae51ddb77ec5  partial_call  symbol missing (subject)
      process_date 2026-10-30 (its market date; the type has no other)
  e34ddd44-1ed2-4b30-b668-be3f16e11dce  spin_off      new_symbol missing (new);
      source SNTI; ex_date 2026-10-30, process_date 2026-11-02
  6abeb209-f747-4bf3-a231-67b8c0984d4a  stock_merger  acquiree_symbol missing
      (acquiree); acquirer JAGX; effective and process date 2026-11-02

Ids, types, dates, the missing field and the present symbols are the record's.
Every other field (CUSIPs, rates, the call's price and lottery dates) is a
synthetic placeholder that passes the read's validators. A missing symbol is
`null`, which the read treats as "" (AlpacaClient.corporate_actions,
UNRESOLVED ROWS). The rows go through the REAL `AlpacaClient.corporate_actions`
parser over a fake HTTP session, then the runner's own step 3b
(`run._corporate_actions`) under the mode `run.corporate_actions_for` reads
from C4's book json. Synthetic data: this is a statement about the code, not
about what Alpaca will list.

WHAT IT MEASURES. A FLAT C4 account (the dry sessions: DRY_RUN=1 sends nothing,
so the account the team lead says has never traded stays flat [U: not read
here]) gives every name the target-only window [as-of, session]: a missing
party is treated as each of those names, so a row blocks only while its date is
inside that window (corp_actions.blocking_events, UNRESOLVED ROWS). Of the three,
only the JAGX merger blocks, and only the session of 2026-11-03. A HELD account
(after arming) reaches back to each name's last fill (THE WINDOW), so all three
block every session until the team lead acknowledges each (`ca-ack`) or every
held name is traded after them, which under `halt` nothing does.

Hermetic: netguard refuses any socket; the key file holds test constants.
