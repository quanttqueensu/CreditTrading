"""The combiner is DARK: the released book json decides byte-identically to de6e9c5.

WHAT IS PROVED (quantt/session/combine.py, OFF BY DEFAULT). With the book json
as released (one sleeve, `cef_discount`, no `risk_budget`), `load_sleeves`
returns None and the session takes the single-spec path; that path must give
the same targets, orders, plan.json and plan_sha as the code BEFORE the
combiner, de6e9c5 (release-20261028-1, what prod runs). Four tests:

  1. `test_the_released_book_json_takes_the_single_sleeve_path`: the released
     json, read by `load_sleeves` and by `default_deps` (broker client faked),
     gives `sleeves=None`. That is the bridge: tests 2 and 3 drive the session
     with `sleeves` absent, which is what None means.
  2. `test_synthetic_book_is_the_code_before_the_combiner` (NEVER SKIPS). A
     generated 13-fund panel (integer LCG and IEEE + - x / only, so the inputs
     are the same bytes on any machine; `panel` in the pin is their hash) and a
     fixture spec, decided as of 2026-09-25 on a flat and a held book, then the
     full session three ways: the late-market DECIDE, its SEND at 15:52:30 on
     the session date (armed, so orders go to the fake broker), and a `cls`
     evening run that decides and sends. Every output is hashed and compared
     with hashes COMPUTED BY de6e9c5's CODE. The generator and the fixture spec
     are copied from `test_c4_synthetic_pin.py` on branch `simon` (made for the
     same purpose at 66ec3df); the pins are this tree's own.
  3. `test_real_sleeve_on_the_real_panel_is_the_code_before_the_combiner`. The
     same on the real sleeve, a copy of the real panels' universe rows through
     2026-09-25 (the `test_nav_gate.py` and `test_c4_keys_noop.py` pattern:
     half the day-one book held, so the band trades and holds), and the core's
     spec AS IT WAS BEFORE CEF TRIAL 53 (cef_discount.v7.20260928), read from git
     at 35b429f (`pre_trial_spec`). Until 2026-11-01 this read the live spec,
     which then was v7. The activation made the live spec v8, and de6e9c5's code
     cannot run v8's `sizing_multiplier`, so the code-versus-code proof keeps
     v7. A pin is only a proof on the inputs it was made on, so the copy's
     content and that spec are hashed, and when either is not what the pin was
     made on, or git cannot show the spec, the test WARNS and skips, naming
     both. Test 2 is the one that never skips.
  3b. `test_real_sleeve_on_the_real_panel_live_spec_v9`: the same five outputs
     on the LIVE spec as released by CEF trial 53 amendment 1 (team lead
     2026-11-02): v9, with `sizing_multiplier` 1.30 applied. The pin was made on
     the amendment's tree (trial53-amend1), not on older code, so it is a
     regression pin of the released book. It is not a no-op proof: that is
     test 3, plus test_sizing_multiplier_noop.py. It FAILS, rather than skips,
     on any spec but v9 at x1.30. It also asserts that the live spec is the
     pre-trial spec plus the multiplier and nothing else, and that the
     multiplier acts (every weight target says `smult=1.3000`). Until the
     amendment it was a v8 pin at x1.13, made on 3478159, and it is in git at
     8b14298. v8's bytes are kept as `PINNED_INPUT_V8` / `v8_spec()` (git at
     862b1d0) for test_panels_noop's 862b1d0 pins.
  4. `test_one_sleeve_through_the_combiner_sends_what_the_single_sleeve_book_sends`,
     on the synthetic panel and (if present) the real one. Not a pin. It is a
     check of the combiner's arithmetic: the live spec as the only sleeve at
     risk_budget 1.0 must send the same orders, with the same plan_sha, as the
     single-sleeve path. plan.json differs only where it must: each target is a
     netted `qty`, every reason says which sleeve wanted it, and `combine` is
     added.

HOW THE PINS WERE MADE. `git archive de6e9c5` into a scratch directory (the
real `data/` symlinked in, read only), this file copied into that tree, and
`_hashes(_session(...))` run there: the synthetic pin unseeded and under
PYTHONHASHSEED 1, 2 and 3, the real-panel pin unseeded and under 1 (identical
every time); then on the combiner tree (identical again). To re-derive one --
after a deliberate change of the single-sleeve path, a pandas or numpy upgrade,
or a panel revision through 2026-09-25 -- do exactly that again and paste the
result; never edit a hash by hand.

SEED INDEPENDENCE. Where the sleeve's `max_gross_stress` BINDS on a held
book, its last ulp depends on the hash seed (the band's set union fixes the
order `_cap_gross` sums in; 11790b5's commit message, branch `simon`). It does
not bind on either held book here, and both tests assert so.

Hermetic: test_run's FakeClient for the broker, fixed clocks, no refresh, no
close-history reader (the pre-flight records UNMEASURED, a fixed string), and
the stale-NAV gate and the drawdown check off: their own report-mode proofs
(test_nav_gate.py, test_drawdown.py) compare off with report on this tree, so
with test 3 they carry over. netguard refuses any socket.
