"""Plan row 6A: the runner sizes, gates and NAV-checks each sleeve on that sleeve's OWN panel.

WHAT IS TESTED (quantt/session/run.py PER-SLEEVE PANELS; C4 deploy plan §1 row
6A, §2 step 5). Every session here is built by `default_deps`, with only the
broker client, the clock, the halts, the log and (where named) the refresh
faked, so the readers under test are the ones prod runs.

THE FIXTURE. Two `cef_discount` sleeves on two panels:
  * A, test_combine_noop's synthetic spec on its generated 13-fund panel
    (`SYA`..`SYM`), with no `panel_source`: the core's paths, pointed at the copy;
  * B, the same spec on thirteen other names (`SBA`..`SBM`) with `panel_source`
    naming `data/cef_b/` under a scratch repository root: the same generator's
    rows under B's names, prices and NAVs x1.5.
A's (core) panel ALSO carries a DECOY for each of B's names: every row, prices
and NAVs x3, and every as-of NAV dated. Nothing may ever read a B name from
there; a reader that did would size B at the decoy's price, or pass gate 5 on
the decoy's NAV date, and each test below would see it.

EACH TEST FAILS ON 16e0c6e (release-20261029-2's code), where the runner read
every close and NAV of a combined book from the core paths, and refused a spec
on another panel in `default_deps` and `sleeve_targets` (`require_core_panel`):
  1. sleeve B's closes come only from its own panel (16e0c6e: gate 5 passes on
     the decoys, then the session FAILs in sleeve B's `require_core_panel`);
  2. gate 5, per sleeve, reads B's own NAV file (16e0c6e: the decoy's as-of
     NAV passes it, then FAIL as in 1);
  3. an absent panel file refuses, naming it (16e0c6e: FAIL with the row-6A
     message, which says nothing is absent; the single-spec book refused in
     `default_deps`);
  4. a universe its own panel does not cover refuses, naming the names and the
     file (16e0c6e: the row-6A message);
  5. the single-spec book's missing-NAV hold reads that spec's own NAV file
     (16e0c6e: refused in `default_deps`);
and the refresh and stale-NAV wiring row 6A adds: a panel this tree has no
fetcher for is refused at step 1 (gate 5, recorded), a book on two panels is
too, and data.stale_nav on another panel is refused before any client is built.

Hermetic: no network (netguard), no key file (the client factory is faked),
every panel generated under tmp_path; the real data/ is never read.
