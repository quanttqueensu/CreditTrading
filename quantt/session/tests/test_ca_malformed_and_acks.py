"""The corporate-action gate: a malformed row that cannot be ours is skipped and recorded; an acknowledged action clears.

Two team-lead rulings of 2026-10-29, answered interactively on the review of
4c63b1f (corp_actions.py, "MALFORMED ROWS" and "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"):

A. A corporate-action row with an empty or null required symbol used to fail
   the whole read, so under `halt` one bad row for ANY issuer refused every
   session until Alpaca fixed it. Now it is skipped, and recorded in plan.json,
   the run record and one log line naming its id and the missing field, when
   every symbol present in it is outside the book's universe. It still refuses
   when it could be ours: a present symbol is one of the universe's, which
   covers a merger with our fund on one side and the other symbol null.
B. A backfilled name change, redemption, worthless removal or partial call is
   dated by its process date, falls on the long window, and under `halt` never
   clears by itself. It clears by the team lead's recorded acknowledgement:
   `<state>/ca_acks.json`, written only by `python3 -m quantt.session ca-ack`.
   The gate clears that action id only; anything else, a new action on the
   same fund included, still halts. An unreadable file refuses.

Every test here FAILS on 4c63b1f (`git archive 4c63b1f`, this file copied
in). The two no-op tests compare with pins COMPUTED BY 4c63b1f's CODE: with no
malformed row, no acknowledgement and no backfilled action, the orders sent,
send.json, plan.json, orders.jsonl, STARTED (bar its pid) and every run record
are byte-identical to 4c63b1f. Their pins match there; they fail there only
where they assert that the new path ran (the read's keywords, the file read).

HOW THE PINS WERE MADE (2026-10-29). `_outputs` run on this worktree while it
was exactly 4c63b1f (clean), under PYTHONHASHSEED unset, 0 and 1: identical
every time. Re-derive only after a deliberate change to what a session writes,
by running `_outputs` on the commit before that change; never edit by hand.

Hermetic. The broker is test_corp_actions.CAClient (test_run.FakeClient plus
the corporate-action read) whose `corporate_actions` is the REAL
`AlpacaClient.corporate_actions` parser over a fake HTTP session, so the rows
go through the code prod runs. Its key file is a temporary file holding test
constants, never config/.env; netguard refuses any socket. The rows are the
reference's examples (test_alpaca_client.CA_REFERENCE) and synthetic rows
built from its field lists: they test the code, never a claim about the market.
