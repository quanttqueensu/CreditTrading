"""C4 step 1: the sleeve's four optional keys, ABSENT, leave the 13-name book byte-identical.

WHAT STEP 1 IS (`results/cef/C4_DEPLOY_PLAN_2026-10-27.md` §1 row 1, §2 step 1).
The `cef_discount` sleeve learns four optional frozen-spec keys so that trial C4
can later run as a SECOND spec of the same sleeve rather than as a copy of the
z-score: `panel_source`, `nav_repeat_mask` (M1), `zero_volume_mask` (M2) and
`below_min_names`. The live spec carries none of them, and the house rule is
that a new key must default to current behaviour, PROVED byte-for-byte
(CLAUDE.md; `/spec-change` step 3). The plan's §4 says it again for every C4
step: the 13's plan.json and `plan_sha` stay byte-identical until C4 is
switched on.

HOW IT IS PROVED, AND WHY THE PINS ARE PINS.

  1. `test_keys_absent_is_byte_identical_to_the_code_before_them`. The real
     sleeve, the real live spec and the real panels, decided as of 2026-09-25
     on a held book (half the day-one book, the `test_nav_gate.py` fixture, so
     the band both trades and holds), driven through `run_session` exactly as
     the drawdown and stale-NAV proofs drive it. Every output -- the day-one
     and held-book sleeve targets (reasons and 17-digit floats included, via
     `_fingerprint`), the exit code, the orders, the plan's targets, `plan_sha`
     and the plan.json bytes -- is hashed and compared with hashes COMPUTED BY
     THE SLEEVE AS IT WAS BEFORE THE KEYS EXISTED (66ec3df, `simon`), by running
     `_session_hashes` on that tree. The pins are those numbers, not
     expectations.

     A pin is only a proof on the inputs it was made on. The panel is a
     refreshed vendor series (the 2026-10-15 refresh took in Yahoo's corrections
     of 2026-09-25, `test_nav_gate.py`), the prod VM's panel was captured at
     other times than the laptop's, and the live spec may be bumped. So the
     test copies the panel rows it reads (the universe, through ASOF) into
     tmp_path in a canonical order, hashes that content and the live spec, and
     SKIPS, naming both hashes, when either is not what the pin was made on.
     Skipping is the honest answer there: the old code's output on a different
     input is unmeasured, and comparing against it would be comparing against a
     number nobody computed.

  2. `test_keys_present_at_their_defaults_are_byte_identical_to_absent`. Runs
     on whatever real panel and live spec are present, so it never skips for a
     refresh: the live spec with the four keys ABSENT against the same spec with
     each key SET TO ITS DEFAULT (`panel_source` naming the `data/cef/` files,
     both masks `false`, `below_min_names` "flatten"). It keeps the absent path
     and the explicit-default path the same object after the pins have gone
     stale.

The synthetic tests of what each key DOES are in
`src/deploy/tests/test_c4_sleeve_keys.py`.

`data/` is gitignored: without the real panels both tests SKIP, naming the
file. Hermetic otherwise: test_run's FakeClient for the broker, a fixed clock,
no refresh, the stale-NAV gate and the drawdown check off (their own proofs
cover them), and netguard refuses any socket.
