"""The corporate-action gate: which actions block, and what each mode does to a session.

Alpaca paper processes no corporate actions, so a held name that splits keeps
its old share count while its price moves to the new basis
(`quantt/session/corp_actions.py`). These tests pin the window that decides
which actions block (`blocking_events`, pure), the dating of each held name
from the account's own order history (`held_since`), and the three book-json
settings end to end through `run_session` with fake deps: absent (no gate,
today's behaviour), `report` (record and send) and `halt` (refuse, naming the
event; refuse too when the feed cannot be read).

Hermetic: the client is `test_run.FakeClient` with a `corporate_actions` method
added, state lives under tmp_path, and the root conftest blocks the network.
Events are synthetic; they test the code, never a claim about the market.
