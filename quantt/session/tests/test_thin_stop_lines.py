"""CEF trial 55 (te4): the K0-K3 report lines (quantt/session/drawdown.py `thin_stop_record`), on synthetic records.

results/cef/PREREG_THIN_TRADE_ELIGIBLE_2026-11-03.md §6.3 requires report lines for K0-K3 in the
activation release, "in report mode and tested", and the team lead's ruling of 2026-11-03 on a
short skipped at send ("accept it and label it") needs the label. Every input here is a literal:
a calendar of consecutive sessions, plan.json / send.json dicts per session, an equity series,
positions, closes and thresholds. Each test fails on the code before this commit, which has no
`thin_stop_record`.

K3's run (review fix after 7fcc2b7). The first build's K3 test hand-built the earlier records, and
not in the shape the runner writes them, so it passed with K3 reading one close too far back.
`_chain` now decides session after session as run.py does, storing each record where run.py
stores it, and the K3 tests read those records; a runner-level test does the same on plan.json
files. Those tests fail on 7fcc2b7.

A reduced decision is one whose targets were SENT (§4.2; review fix F2 after 7fcc2b7): a
decided reduced plan whose send did not go opens no episode, earns K1 nothing and is not a
reduced close; one whose send cannot be read leaves the episode UNMEASURED. Those tests fail
on the F3 commit.

K0 and the K1-K3 lines read eod_equity through the session before the as-of, labelled one
session stale (team lead's ruling 2026-11-03: at the 22:00 decide the as-of's row is never
there). `read_through` None is the as-of reading the earlier tests pin; the read-through tests
fail on the F2 commit (a323971), which has no `read_through`.

The send-skip label (review fix F3 after 7fcc2b7) reads whether the send went (`_send_state`:
plan.json's orders and plan_sha, send.json's exit, plan_sha, `final` and `not_final`,
<D>/STARTED). The prior plans and send records here therefore carry the fields run.py writes
(`plan`, `send`, `reader`'s `started`); test_thin_send_state.py checks that shape against the
records the real send writes. The tests of a send that did not go, or whose outcome is not
established, fail on the F1 commit, which labelled a refused or dry send's list a lost short.
A FAILed send whose `final` records what went is a reduced decision sent in part (the runner
owner's review 2026-11-04, items 5 and 10); that test fails on 87ad4e9.

The runner's side (plan.json carries `thin_stops` only with the key set, and the label read from
the previous session's send.json) is in tests/test_trade_eligible_runner.py.
