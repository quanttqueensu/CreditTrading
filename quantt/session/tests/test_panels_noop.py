"""Plan row 6A is DARK: the session `default_deps` builds for today's book json is byte-identical to 862b1d0.

WHAT ROW 6A CHANGED (results/cef/C4_DEPLOY_PLAN_2026-10-27.md §1 row 6A, §2
step 5; quantt/session/run.py PER-SLEEVE PANELS). `default_deps` used to read
every close, NAV date and close history, and point the stale-NAV gate, at the
core paths `cef_discount.PX_PATH` / `NAV_PATH`; it now reads each name from the
panel its own sleeve decides on (`BookPanels`), and `sleeve_targets` takes
MarketState's prices from the sleeve's own price file. For the released book
(one sleeve, the core spec) that is the same file, read by the same call.

WHY A NEW PIN. The pins of test_combine_noop.py, test_missing_nav_hold.py and
test_c4_synthetic_pin.py drive `run_session` with deps they build themselves,
reading `cefmod.PX_PATH` directly, so they prove `run_session` and
`sleeve_targets` unchanged but never run the readers `default_deps` builds,
which are what row 6A rewired. Here the session is built BY `default_deps` from
today's book json -- late_market with bp_shortfall "scale", the stale-NAV gate
and the drawdown check in `report` -- with only what must be faked replaced
after it is built: the broker client (test_run's FakeClient), the refresh (a
fixture exit code), the halts, the clock, the log, and the stale-NAV gate's
CEFConnect reader (refusing every request, as prod's has since 2026-10-21).
The closes, NAVs, close history, targets, execution, gates and sleeves are
`default_deps`' own.

TODAY'S BOOK JSON, BOTH WAYS. `data.missing_nav = "hold"` (with
`missing_nav_max_sessions` 2) is being set by a separate change, so the book is
pinned with the key ABSENT and with it SET, each built from the released file
(`_book`): the runner-read keys of each variant are hashed into the pin's
`input`, so a later edit of the released json that changes what the runner
reads fails here, naming it, instead of passing on a book nobody pinned.

SCENARIOS (test_missing_nav_hold's, so the same branches are reached): a
complete day (the evening DECIDE, then its SEND at 15:52:30, armed) and a day
with one as-of NAV missing (the evening decide, the final check in late-market
mode, and the final check in `cls` mode, armed). Each is hashed by
test_missing_nav_hold's `_hashes`: exit, plan.json, plan_sha, orders, targets,
refusals, the run record, nav_gate.csv, send.json and what reached the broker.
With the key absent every missing-NAV day is refused; with it set, the final
check holds the fund and decides (and the cls run sends).

  * `test_synthetic_default_deps_is_5e627ff` NEVER SKIPS: test_combine_noop's
    generated 13-fund panel and fixture spec.
  * `test_real_panel_default_deps_is_5e627ff`: the live spec and a copy of the
    real panels through 2026-09-25 (test_combine_noop's input pin); it warns and
    skips when the copy or the spec is not what that pin was made on.

HOW THE PINS WERE MADE. `git archive 5e627ff` (release-20261029-2, prod's code)
into a scratch directory with the real data/ symlinked in, read only; this file
copied into that tree; `print_pins()` run there in a fresh process, unseeded
and under PYTHONHASHSEED 1; then on the row-6A tree (identical every time).
Every tmp path is replaced by `<WORK>` before hashing. To re-derive, do exactly
that again; never edit a hash by hand. This file uses only names that exist at
5e627ff for that reason; the behaviour row 6A adds is tested in
test_sleeve_panels.py.

THE CORPORATE-ACTION GATE (c4-integrate, 2026-10-29). Main (35b429f) added the
corporate-action gate after 5e627ff and set `corporate_actions.mode = "halt"` in
the released book json. 5e627ff's code (= cee16ad's, release-20261029-3, prod)
never reads that block, so the pins above are made, and checked, with it
REMOVED (`_book`, GATE_BLOCK): with the gate absent the integrated tree is
cee16ad, byte for byte. The released json AS IS -- the gate in halt, the hold
on -- is pinned separately (`RELEASED_*`, `test_*_released_book_is_35b429f`):
made on 35b429f (main, which c4-integrate was cut from) the same way, with
`git archive 35b429f` in place of 5e627ff, and the client given a feed that
lists nothing and one filled order per held name (test_c4_synthetic_pin's
`_gate_arm`), so the gate can date each held name and finds it CLEAR. Those
two pins together are the core's no-op proof for the C4 integration: the
session default_deps builds is cee16ad's with the gate absent and 35b429f's
as released.

RE-PINNED ON 862b1d0 (merge of c4-integrate onto main, 2026-11-02). Main moved
on after c4-integrate was cut: release-20261102-1 (862b1d0) is prod's code, the
released book json sets the gate to `report` (team lead 2026-11-02) and names spec
v8 in its description, and the live spec is cef_discount.v8.20261101 (CEF trial
53, `sizing_multiplier` 1.13). The 5e627ff/35b429f pins above were proofs about
book jsons and code that no longer ship, and both `book` hashes failed, as they
are built to. So BOTH families are now made on `git archive 862b1d0`, the code
the merged tree must equal for the core, the same way as before (this file
copied in, data/ symlinked read only, `print_pins` in fresh processes, unseeded
and under PYTHONHASHSEED 1; identical every time, and on c4-rel): the gate-absent
pair (`print_pins("gate_absent")`) and the released pair (`print_pins("released")`).
Two edits made that possible, and neither changes what is hashed: the clear feed
takes main's keywords (`_ClearFeedClient`), and the real-panel pins read the LIVE
spec as released, v8, against test_combine_noop's `PINNED_INPUT_V8` (the same panel
copy and v8's sha), where they used to need v7 and so skipped on every machine
since trial 53. The 5e627ff and 35b429f pins are in git at 8b001c9.

SINCE CEF TRIAL 53 AMENDMENT 1 (2026-11-02) the live spec is v9 (x1.30). The 862b1d0
pins are unchanged, byte for byte. Their real-panel pair now reads v8 from git at
862b1d0 (`test_combine_noop.v8_spec`, `_v8_input`) instead of the live file, so they
still run. The book json still names the live spec's path, as when they were made.

Hermetic: no network (netguard; the CEFConnect reader raises), no key file (the
client factory is faked), state under tmp_path, the real panels read only.
