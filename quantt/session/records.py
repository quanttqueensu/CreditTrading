LAYOUT
------
    $QUANTT_STATE_DIR/
      AUTO_ARMED                 created by the team lead after the first go (gate 2)
      <YYYY-MM-DD>/              the SESSION date (ET), the day the orders are for
        plan.json                the latest plan; once STARTED exists, the plan
                                 that was transmitted, never overwritten after
        STARTED                  written, exclusively, BEFORE the first order
        orders.jsonl             one line per submit attempt / response / lookup
        runs/<utc-stamp>-<mode>.json   every run's full record, never overwritten

WHY EACH PIECE
--------------
  * STARTED is the local half of gate 6 and CLAUDE.md order-path rule 2 ("must
    record that it started before its first order goes"). It is created with
    `os.link` from a fully-written, fsynced temp file: `link` fails if the name
    exists, so two runs racing cannot both believe they are first, and a crash
    can never leave a half-written STARTED that reads as absent.
  * orders.jsonl is appended and fsynced line by line AS the orders go, so a
    crash between two POSTs leaves an exact record of which ids were attempted.
    The intent line is written before each POST, the response after it.
  * plan.json is what `verify.py` and a human read. A later refused or dry run
    the same day must not overwrite the plan that actually went, so once
    STARTED exists plan.json is left alone; runs/ keeps every run regardless.

Nothing here ever writes a credential: the session never holds one (the client
keeps keys in its HTTP session headers only).
