"""Sleeve targets -> the whole-share MOC orders one session sends. Pure: no network, no disk.

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE
--------------------------
Everything that turns "the strategy wants weight w in PDI" into "sell 312 PDI
at the close" lives here, in one function with no I/O, so that the exact list a
human approves can be recomputed from the same inputs and hashed
(`plan_sha`, gate 2: what was approved is what is sent). The IBKR-era executor
spread this across a sizing helper, a ledger and the broker adapter, and the
two worst incidents in this book's history came from the seams:

  * Dust orders (2026-09-08, results/cef/DUST_ORDERS_2026-09.md): a band HOLD
    emitted as a weight made a round trip through two different closes and came
    back as a few shares of rounding drift, sent as live MOC orders. So a qty
    target (the sleeve's HOLD) is used EXACTLY as given here -- its diff against
    the holding it was computed from is zero by construction -- and never
    re-derived through a price.
  * The invented book size: targets once sized against a $500k default while the
    account was marked otherwise. So `equity` is a required input, from the
    broker, and a missing close for a name that must be sized raises naming it.

SIZING
------
weight target -> shares = int(trunc(w * equity / close)), i.e. rounded TOWARD
ZERO. Toward zero, not to nearest, because both errors it can make shrink the
book: a long is never bought past its weight and a short is never sold past
it, so rounding can never push gross over `max_gross_stress` (which the sleeve
enforced in weight space) or spend buying power the target did not. The cost is
at most one share per name of under-exposure (prereg v7 section 7, "whole
shares only").

`equity` is the Alpaca account's equity, the same number the runner passes the
sleeve as `extras["sleeve_nav"]`: the band compares held weight q*px/nav against
target, so sizing and banding must share one denominator.

`close` is each name's own last close on or before the as-of date,
`px.ffill().iloc[-1]` per name (CLAUDE.md landmine 6: HYT lags the panel by a
day, so the panel's last row can be NaN for one name). The runner records the
date of every close it passes; gate 5 refuses unless every one is the as-of
date, so the ffill can never silently size on an older print.

NETTING AND THE FLIP
--------------------
One order per symbol per session, because Alpaca rejects opposite-side orders
in one symbol as wash trades (CLAUDE.md landmine 2; docs "user-protection" [V]:
market buy vs market sell is "always rejected", paper included).

A long->short or short->long flip cannot be one order ([S] Alpaca staff 2020:
"you cannot flip position side in one order. You need to flatten the position
first"). RUNNER.md's design was two same-side orders in one session: close to
zero (leg 1), open the other side (leg 2). The verified facts say that second
order is likely rejected:

  [V] Alpaca Learn, "How to fix common trading API errors" (fetched
  2026-09-28): the shares tied to a pending sell "are reserved until the order
  is filled or canceled"; "Alpaca does not support holding long and short
  positions in the same symbol at the same time ... confirm the long position
  is fully closed before submitting a new order to open a short position."
  [S] staff 2023: "The first order to sell just to get the position to 0, and a
  second sell short ... Alpaca currently doesn't support creating two orders
  like that."

A cls close-to-zero is not filled until the auction, so the open leg cannot be
confirmed-closed-first within one session. IMPLEMENTED: `FLIP_SAME_SESSION =
False` -- a flip sends ONLY the closing leg today (client id `...-1`) and says
`flip deferred` in its note; the next session sees a flat position and the
sleeve's band opens the other side from there. The two-leg path is kept behind
the flag, tested, for the day probe 3.2 shows paper accepts it; turning it on is
a team-lead decision, not a code default. A deferred flip leaves the name flat
for one session, which is a small, bounded divergence from the backtest (which
flips instantly) and is logged every time it happens.

SHORTABILITY (gate 7, prereg v7 section 6)
------------------------------------------
Any order that opens or increases a short needs `shortable` exactly True for
that symbol today. If it is not, THAT SYMBOL SENDS NOTHING this session and the
note says why; no other name is substituted. A symbol that needs the check and
is missing from the map raises: an unmeasured borrow is not a shortable one.
Covering a short or selling a long never needs it.

TRANSMIT ORDER (review 2026-09-28)
----------------------------------
The runner stops the batch at the first rejection or ambiguous submit, and a
stopped day is not resumed (gate 6). So the ORDER of the list decides what
the book holds overnight when something fails part-way. Alphabetical order
(the first build) left an arbitrary slice -- on a flat day one, possibly all
the longs from A to H and no shorts. `transmit_sequence` instead orders
greedily so the running net dollar change (sum of signed qty x as-of close
over the orders sent so far) stays as close to zero as it can after every
order: at each step it takes the order that minimises |running net|,
breaking ties by larger notional, then SELL before BUY (a short-open is the
order most likely to be rejected -- Alpaca refuses an HTB short without a
locate and paper has no locates [V] -- and a rejection first means nothing
unhedged went), then symbol and leg. A flip's leg 2 is never placed before
its leg 1. This does not make a partial set neutral; it bounds how far from
neutral any stopping point can be. What to do after a stop is a team-lead
decision (docs/RUNBOOK.md), not something this ordering answers.

THE PLAN HASH
-------------
`plan_sha` is sha256 over a canonical JSON (sorted keys, no whitespace) of what
is TRANSMITTED and nothing else: client_order_id, symbol, side, qty, type,
time_in_force, in list order. Estimates (price, notional) and prose are
excluded on purpose, so a re-run that sends the same orders hashes the same,
and any change to what would be sent -- one share, one symbol, another date in
the id -- changes the hash and fails `--approve`.
