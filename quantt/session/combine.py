"""The multi-sleeve combiner: every ENABLED sleeve of one book, netted into one order per symbol. DARK.

WHY IT EXISTS. One Alpaca account takes ONE order per symbol per session:
Alpaca rejects opposite-side orders in one symbol as wash trades, paper
included (CLAUDE.md landmine 2), and the runner sizes every order from the
account's open positions. Until this module the runner traded exactly one
frozen spec per `Book` (run.py `BOOKS`), and the book json's `sleeves[]` list was
read only by `ops/common.py::deployed_tickers`, for the refresh. Two rulings
make a second sleeve in one account concrete: the CEF account is "one combined
book" (docs/SYSTEM.md §5, 2026-10-09), and the agent lab shares the spare
account with C4, so lab sleeves "must be netted into C4's targets symbol by
symbol" (§5, 2026-10-28). The design is the portfolio framework's phase C
(results/cef/PORTFOLIO_FRAMEWORK_2026-10-15.md §2.10, §7) and the C4 deploy
plan's row 6S (branch `simon`, results/cef/C4_DEPLOY_PLAN_2026-10-27.md). The
team lead approved building it on 2026-10-28: "build the combiner, decide
placement after". Where it runs first is not decided here.

OFF BY DEFAULT, AND THE NO-OP. `load_sleeves` returns None, and the runner takes
its single-spec path exactly as before, unless an ENABLED entry of `sleeves[]`
carries `risk_budget`. The released book json carries none, so the released
session is the code before this module, byte for byte: same targets, orders,
plan.json and plan_sha. Proved against de6e9c5 on the real panel and on a
synthetic panel that never skips (quantt/session/tests/test_combine_noop.py).
With no budget anywhere the book json must still say what the runner trades:
exactly one enabled sleeve, whose spec is the book's (`BOOKS[...].spec_path`).
Anything else raises before the session starts. Until now a second enabled
sleeve was silently not traded while the refresh required its names, so every
day would have been refused (exit 4) for a sleeve nobody was trading.

WHAT IT DOES, for a book whose enabled sleeves all carry `risk_budget`:
  1. Builds each sleeve's targets from its OWN frozen spec, through the same
     `run.sleeve_targets` the single-sleeve book uses (the registry validates
     each spec). Each sleeve is shown only its own holdings (HOLDINGS below).
  2. Sizes each sleeve on its own NAV (THE RISK BUDGET below). Its weights are
     turned into whole shares by `decide.target_shares`, the single-sleeve rule:
     toward zero, and a qty target (the band's HOLD) used exactly as given.
  3. Sums the target shares per symbol and calls `decide.decide` ONCE on the
     netted book: one order per symbol, the flip, shortability and min_trade on
     the NET position, one plan_sha.
  4. Leaves the book-level limits to the runner's existing machinery on the
     netted orders: `fit_to_buying_power` and gate 8 (THE BOOK-LEVEL CAP below).
  5. Returns the per-sleeve record the runner writes to plan.json as `combine`
     (ATTRIBUTION below).
  6. Gate 9 then reads the UNION of the enabled sleeves' universes
     (`book_params`), and gate 5 and the stale-NAV gate act per sleeve
     (`gate.gate_data_by_sleeve`; STALE NAV below).

THE RISK BUDGET. `sleeves[i].risk_budget` = b, in (0, 1]: the sleeve's share
of the book's vol target. The book's vol target is the BOOK spec's
`frozen.vol_target_annual` (the spec `BOOKS[...]` names; framework §2.6: "Today:
σ* = the spec's 6%"). The sleeve is sized on

    sleeve_nav = equity × b × σ_book / σ_sleeve,

with σ_sleeve its own spec's `frozen.vol_target_annual`. Every sleeve this
registry builds vol-targets its own NAV (framework §2.2), so its ex-ante dollar
vol is σ_sleeve × sleeve_nav = b × σ_book × equity: b of the book's target,
whatever target the sleeve's own spec carries. Everything else the sleeve does
in weight units (the band, `min_abs_weight`, its own `max_gross_stress`, the
vol scalar's clip) stays relative to its own NAV: a sleeve at budget b is the
same strategy run on a smaller book. With one sleeve whose spec is the book's
and b = 1, sleeve_nav is the account equity to the bit (b × σ / σ = 1.0
exactly), which is what lets the one-sleeve combiner reproduce the
single-sleeve orders and plan_sha (test_combine_noop.py). The budgets
themselves are inputs. They come from the allocation analysis (framework §2.3
to §2.6, phase E), and nothing here derives or bounds their sum: shares of vol
add to more than 1 when sleeves diversify. The book's gross is bounded by the
book-level cap, whatever they sum to.

THE BOOK-LEVEL CAP. ONE `max_gross_stress`, the book spec's, applied once to
the NETTED book by the objects that already apply it: `run.fit_to_buying_power`
scales the opening orders to fit it (bp_shortfall "scale"), and gate 8
(`gate.stress_breach`) refuses what still breaks it. Each sleeve keeps its own
cap inside itself, relative to its own NAV. NOT CHOSEN: a second, weight-space
cap on the combined target (the sleeve's `_cap_gross`, one level up). It would
be a second object named `max_gross_stress` with different semantics from
gate 8's ("a plan that does not add gross always passes"), and it would scale
band holds into trades whenever the book sat a hair above the line at the as-of
closes. THE VALUE IS STALE FOR A COMBINED BOOK. The spec's 1.80 was derived for
the 13 names alone with M_other = $0 (its `_max_gross_stress_note`). Before a
second sleeve is enabled it must be re-derived on the combined book by the
frozen rule (framework §2.7). That is the allocation analysis's input, like the
budgets, and a spec change of the book spec.

NETTING. One order per symbol, from the sum of the sleeves' whole-share
targets. One long and one short in a symbol cross inside the book and send only
their net. The flip rule (close today, open next session) runs on the net, so
two sleeves holding opposite views never flip the account by themselves
(framework §2.10). min_trade_usd, shortability and the transmit sequence are
`decide`'s, on the net, unchanged. NOT YET ALLOWED ACROSS SLEEVES: while
SHARED_SYMBOLS_ALLOWED is False (below, HOLDINGS) no two enabled sleeves share
a symbol, so each symbol has one owner and its net is that sleeve's target. The
cross-sleeve arithmetic is kept, and tested behind the flag, for when per-sleeve
sub-ledgers exist.

HOLDINGS. Each sleeve is shown the account's positions in its own universe.
Where the universes are disjoint that is exact. The 13 and C4's 74 share none
(C4 plan §0). A HELD position in a symbol two enabled sleeves trade cannot be
split without a per-sleeve sub-ledger, which is not built (framework §2.10,
"virtual sub-ledger"). OVERLAPPING UNIVERSES ARE REFUSED UP FRONT (release-check
of 00ec423). The first build accepted two enabled sleeves sharing a symbol and
refused only a HELD shared position. That lets day one net the shared symbol
from flat and send, and then every later slot FAILs on the position day one
built: nothing can trade or exit until someone flattens it by hand. So
`load_sleeves` rejects enabled sleeves whose universes share a symbol, naming
the symbols, and `decide` refuses the same, whatever built the sleeves. The
held-shared check stays behind it, for the flag.

ATTRIBUTION (plan.json `combine`). For each enabled sleeve: its spec, budget,
vol targets and sleeve_nav; whether it was decided or held (and why); the
stale-NAV holds it got; and per symbol of its universe its attributed current
shares, its target shares, the target's kind and its reason. Together with
plan.json's netted `targets` and `orders` (after any fit), that is everything
verify, score and TCA need to split P&L by sleeve. None of them does yet. The
framework's fill rule (§2.10), to apply to FILLS when they do: a symbol's fill
is allocated pro rata to each sleeve's signed target change in it; an internal
cross trades nothing, and both legs are marked at the official close.

GATE 5, PER SLEEVE (`gate.gate_data_by_sleeve`). Each sleeve's names are
checked on their own. Before the final check (`nav_gate.final_check_at`, the
close minus 90 minutes) a failing sleeve refuses the whole decide, as today, so
the next slot retries and a NAV that lands at 22:30 is still traded. Holding a
sleeve at 22:00 would have cost it the day for data that was merely late. From
the final check, a sleeve still failing is HELD (its attributed shares kept, no
order in its names), and the other sleeves decide. That is the decoupling the
C4 plan asks for: one missing NAV in one sleeve no longer costs every other
sleeve the day. fetch_daily's exit 4 (INCOMPLETE) is exactly that per-name
condition, so it is attributed by the per-name check. Every other refresh
failure stays book-wide. A held sleeve's positions are still valued by gate 8 at
their last close, whose date is in plan.json's `closes`. A position with no
close at all refuses the book, as before.

STALE NAV, PER SLEEVE. The stale-NAV gate runs once over the union (one
panel, one CEFConnect read per name, one record). A name it holds goes ONLY to
the sleeves whose universe contains it, as that sleeve's `extras["nav_hold"]`,
and is added only when that sleeve has one, as in the single-sleeve book. It
runs on an INCOMPLETE refresh (exit 4) too, because that is the one refresh
failure after which some sleeves still decide (run.py `_nav_gate`; the first
build skipped it there and sent those sleeves unchecked). A
deferral stays book-wide by construction: there is one plan per day (run.py,
DEFERRAL AND THE ORDER PATH), and it cannot be decided for one sleeve now and
another later. It costs the other sleeves time, never the day, because from the
final check every unverified name is held by the sleeve that owns it.

NOT BUILT HERE (each named so nobody assumes it): per-sleeve sub-ledgers, and so
any symbol two enabled sleeves share (lab sleeves netting into C4's own names
need them first); a per-sleeve opening session (a sleeve added to a live
account opens at its band edge, because the account is not flat); per-sleeve
panels (closes and NAVs come from the core panel, `cef_discount.PX_PATH`;
C4 plan row 6A); a per-sleeve stale-NAV mode; sleeve `state` close_only or flat,
and sleeve-scoped halts (framework §3.5); the P&L split in verify, score and
TCA; and the combined `max_gross_stress` re-derivation.
