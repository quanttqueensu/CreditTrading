"""The third score: auction-marked P&L plus the distributions a real account would book.

WHY IT EXISTS
-------------
Alpaca paper credits no dividends [V: docs.alpaca.markets/us/docs/paper-trading,
fetched 2026-09-28]. On a CEF's ex-date its price drops by about the distribution.
So a paper LONG loses that drop with nothing credited back, and a paper SHORT
gains it without paying the distribution a real short owes its lender. Measured
2026-10-08 (`scripts/xasset/book_profile.py`): the book has recently been net
short distribution yield, a distribution leg of about −0.6 to −0.9%/yr. The two
existing scores (`score.py`) therefore flatter the book against a real account.
The team lead ruled on 2026-10-09 (`docs/SYSTEM.md` §5) to carry a third line
beside them. This module is that line.

THE RULE
--------
For session D, with `held` = the signed shares held at the START of D (verify's
`held_into_close`, q0, read back from `<state>/<D>/reconcile.json`):

    distribution_pnl_D = sum_s held[s] * cash_per_share[s, ex_date == D]
    auction_pnl_with_distributions_D = auction_pnl_D + distribution_pnl_D

The holder at the previous close is the one entitled on the ex-date. Under T+1
the record date is the ex-date, so a long is credited and a short is charged.
Shares bought or sold on D trade ex, so D's fills earn nothing here.
`auction_pnl_D` (from `scores.csv`) already carries the ex-date price drop, so
the sum is what a real account filled in the auction would have earned, gross of
borrow and fees.

WHY D IS SCORED TWO SESSIONS LATE (review 2026-10-09)
-----------------------------------------------------
The first build scored D at D's own 17:30 verify. It wrote 0.0 when neither
source listed D. But at 17:30 the second source often had not caught up:
- on at least 3 of 6 days measured (2026-09-30 to 10-07), the collector's
  `distributions` step finished after 17:30 ET;
- yfinance lists an ex-date only after it passes, and whether it lists it the
  same day is [U];
- the panel is not rewritten at all if any ticker's fetch fails.

So a zero written then could be "Alpaca is silent" alone, which is exactly what
Alpaca warns against ("may not be available immediately after they are
announced" [V]). Now:
- each verify run scores every session D at least `LAG_SESSIONS` sessions old
  (and at most `LOOKBACK_SESSIONS`) that does not yet have a MEASURED row;
- a zero is written only when the panel FILE was rewritten after the close of
  the session following D. That means two independent sources have both been
  silent for a full session after the ex-date. Otherwise the name is UNMEASURED,
  and a later run retries it.

WHERE THE AMOUNTS COME FROM, AND WHEN ONE IS UNMEASURED
-------------------------------------------------------
Primary: Alpaca's corporate actions (`AlpacaClient.distributions`). These are the
broker's own data and list DECLARED distributions weeks ahead.
Second source: the repo's yfinance panel, `data/cef/cef_distributions.parquet`.
It rounds to 3 decimals where Alpaca has 4. Measured 2026-10-09 on the 13 names,
June to August: 28 of the 40 common events differed, all by ≤ 0.0005 and none by
more. The resolution rules:

  both list D, |diff| ≤ ROUNDING_TOL per event  -> Alpaca's (more precise) amount
  both list D, |diff| > ROUNDING_TOL            -> UNMEASURED, naming both values
  only Alpaca lists D                           -> Alpaca's amount (noted)
  only the panel lists D                        -> UNMEASURED: Alpaca's silence is not a zero
  neither lists D, the panel is current         -> 0.0, naming the panel's write time
  neither lists D, the panel is not current     -> UNMEASURED; retried next run

Never averaged. Every name's row records the rule that applied and the Alpaca
event ids and kinds behind its amount, so a payout listed under two types could
be audited. A name that is UNMEASURED makes the day's distribution P&L
UNMEASURED: a sum with a missing term is not the sum, as in `score.py`.

IT NEVER CHANGES THE VERDICT
----------------------------
It runs after verify has written the verdict, `scores.csv` and `reconcile.json`.
It writes only `<state>/distribution_scores.csv`, one row per session, upserted
atomically. A measured row is final. An UNMEASURED row is replaced by the next
run that can measure the day.
