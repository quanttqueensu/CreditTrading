"""Score one session, gross: Alpaca's official end-of-day figure, a snapshot, and the auction mark.

WHY MORE THAN ONE NUMBER
------------------------
The paper account is the competition's official record, and it is scored on
gross P&L (team lead, D19/D20, 2026-09-15). But Alpaca paper does NOT run a
closing auction: staff say a paper MOC order is filled like a plain market
order at the current quote [S: forum staff posts 2021-05-18 and 2023-01-24;
`results/ops/ALPACA_API_FACTS_2026-09-28.md` §4]. So the account's P&L is a
number about Alpaca's simulator, and a real-money version of this book would
have been filled in the auction instead. The team lead's decision
(2026-09-28, `docs/RUNNER.md` "Scoring") is to carry both, side by side,
labelled, and never blended into one column.

WHICH ALPACA NUMBER IS OFFICIAL (team lead, 2026-10-19)
-------------------------------------------------------
Until 2026-10-19, (a) below was called "the official number". It is not. The
17:30 ET read is marked after the close. On the four days compared on
2026-10-19 (09-29, 10-05, 10-07, 10-16) it disagreed with Alpaca's own
end-of-day portfolio history on every one of them, by tens to hundreds of
dollars. On the same days the history agreed with (b), the auction-marked
score, to within fifty cents [V: main session, 2026-10-19, a live
portfolio-history read against verify.log and scores.csv; relayed, not re-read
here]. The team lead's ruling (`docs/SYSTEM.md` §5, 2026-10-19):

  (o) `OfficialPnL` -- Alpaca's end-of-day portfolio history
      (GET /v2/account/portfolio/history, timeframe 1D), EOD(D) - EOD(previous
      session). THE official daily P&L of record. Computed by
      `official_change` below from points the client has already checked
      (`AlpacaClient.eod_equity_history`). When D's point is missing, or its
      stamp is still in the future at the read, the figure is PENDING with the
      reason, and NOTHING stands in for it -- not the snapshot, not the
      auction mark. The series of record is `<state>/eod_equity.csv`, which
      the collector keeps (`quantt/collect/collect.py`, step `eod_equity`).
  (a) `alpaca_equity_change` -- the account's `equity - last_equity` as Alpaca
      reports it at the moment of the read: a SNAPSHOT, kept and labelled
      "snapshot HH:MM ET" on the verify line. It is whatever Alpaca marks the
      positions at when it is read (for a 17:30 ET read that may include
      after-hours quotes [U]). Its column in scores.csv keeps its name,
      `alpaca_equity_change_usd`, because other code reads that file by
      column name and its header is fixed.
  (b) `auction_pnl` -- every position held into D's close marked from the
      previous session's official closing-auction print to D's, plus every fill
      on D marked from its fill price to D's auction print:

          sum_held  q0 * (A_D - A_prev)  +  sum_fills  signed_qty * (A_D - fill_price)

      `q0` is the signed share count held at the START of D (before D's fills);
      `signed_qty` is +qty for a buy, -qty for a sell. The second term is
      exactly "the fill was not at the auction price": it is zero when a fill
      prints at A_D. Together they are the P&L of the end-of-D book at auction
      marks, which is what a live account's P&L would have been had every
      fill been an auction fill.

All three are GROSS. Alpaca paper charges no borrow, pays no dividends and levies no
regulatory fees [V: docs.alpaca.markets/us/docs/paper-trading, fetched
2026-09-28], and (b) adds none either. `COST_BASIS` says so on every row. The
real-money view (the 5 / 15 / 30bp grid and borrow) is research's job, never
mixed in here (CLAUDE.md research rules).

FILL VERSUS AUCTION, IN BASIS POINTS, SIGNED SO POSITIVE IS WORSE FOR US
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
For each (symbol, side): VWAP of D's fills against D's auction print,
    buy:  (vwap - A_D) / A_D * 1e4     (paid more than the auction -> positive)
    sell: (A_D - vwap) / A_D * 1e4     (received less than the auction -> positive)
One sign convention for every row, so a column of positives reads as "paper
filled us worse than the auction would have", whatever the side. The day's
figure is the notional-weighted mean over those rows (weight = qty * A_D).

A MISSING PRINT IS A GAP, NEVER A SUBSTITUTE
--------------------------------------------
If a name that needs a print (held into the close: A_D and A_prev; filled on D:
A_D) has none, that name's auction P&L is UNMEASURED with the reason the
fetcher gave, and so is the day's total -- a sum with a missing term is not the
sum. No bar close, last trade or Alpaca `current_price` stands in: a daily bar
close is updated by condition 6, not M [V: bars reference], so it is a
different number, and a confident-looking total built on one is exactly the
IBKR-era failure CLAUDE.md names (a median fee charged to an unmeasured name).
The day's verdict is then FAIL-with-reason in `verify.py`.

PURE BY CONTRACT
----------------
No I/O, no clock, no broker. Everything arrives as arguments and every input is
checked: a zero or fractional share count, a non-positive or non-finite price,
a side other than buy/sell, or a needed print that is neither a price nor a
recorded gap raises naming it. A caller bug (forgetting to fetch a name) must
not be able to read as "UNMEASURED" -- only a gap the fetcher recorded may.
