"""Install (or update) the CEF book on the prod VM at a release tag, as systemd units.

    qi() { sudo env PYTHONPATH=/home/quantt/prod/quantt-alpaca \\

The installer is imported from the prod clone through PYTHONPATH, because
/home/quantt is mode 750 and the admin user cannot `cd` into it
(docs/RUNBOOK.md section 8.3). `-P` keeps the caller's working directory
off sys.path, so root never imports a module planted there.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
From 2026-09-30 to 10-07 the laptop missed the send on 3 of 6 trading days,
because it was asleep or offline (verify.log, 10-02, 10-05 and 10-06). On
2026-10-07 the team lead moved prod to a cloud VM: Azure for Students, Ubuntu
24.04. This module is install_prod's twin for Linux. The rule is the same: prod
is THIS REPOSITORY AT A TAG AND NOTHING ELSE. So are the jobs, the commands, the
environment and the times; only the scheduler differs (systemd timers, not
launchd). It is a new module rather than an edit to install_prod (RUNBOOK section 8).
It IMPORTS install_prod's JOBS, seed lists, expected_env and timezone reader, so
the two schedulers cannot drift apart without a test failing.

WHERE IT RUNS, AND AS WHOM
--------------------------
On the VM, as root, because it writes /etc/systemd/system and runs systemctl.
It runs with the venv interpreter, the prod clone on PYTHONPATH, and `-B`. Without `-B`,
root would write __pycache__ into the quantt user's tree, leaving root-owned
files there. Every git command runs as the `quantt` user
(`runuser -u quantt --`): git refuses a repository another user owns
("dubious ownership"), and prod's files must stay quantt's. The clone itself is
made once, by quantt/deploy/vm/bootstrap.sh.

TEMPLATES AT THE TAG
--------------------
The units are rendered from templates read AT THE TAG (`git show`). Each is
then parsed and checked, key by key, against what this module expects:

  * the command and environment from install_prod.expected_env;
  * the schedule from `oncalendar(job.schedule)`.

An installer older than the release refuses a release whose units changed,
rather than installing its own idea of them. In that case, check out the tag
as quantt and run the installer again.

DRY RUN BY DEFAULT
------------------
Without `--apply`, it runs every check and prints the steps and the rendered
units. The one write it makes is `git fetch --tags` into the clone's .git,
which changes no checked-out file, no unit and no state. `--apply` writes the
units and runs `systemctl daemon-reload`, after which systemd runs the new
definitions. So a re-install without `--armed` disarms at once. That differs
from launchd, where a written plist is ignored until it is reloaded: here the
reload is part of every apply. `--enable` (only with `--apply`) also enables and
starts the timers and the key service. Enabling is a separate act on purpose,
because enabled timers are what trade.

Arming takes two things: `--armed` (DRY_RUN=0 in the units) and AUTO_ARMED in
the state dir (docs/RUNNER.md gate 2). AUTO_ARMED is the team lead's act; this
module never writes it.

THE TIMERS ARE STOPPED FOR THE RUN (release-check NO-GO, 2026-10-08)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Checking `is-active` at the right moments is not enough. A 15:52 firing that
lands between the last look and daemon-reload starts the OLD unit, say
DRY_RUN=0, and with AUTO_ARMED it sends, while a disarm run would report
DRY_RUN=1 loaded. So `--apply` runs in this order:

  1. stop every quantt-cef timer that is running;
  2. check that no job is running or QUEUED. A queued start reads `is-active`
     inactive, so the check uses ActiveState and Job (measured, see the parser
     comment). The key service `activating` also counts;
  3. checkout, write, daemon-reload, confirm_loaded;
  4. check again. A job found now exits 3 (EXIT_JOB_DURING_INSTALL), naming
     the job, its MainPID and the DRY_RUN it started with, read from /proc and
     never guessed;
  5. restart quantt-secret.service and confirm it is active and the key file is
     a 0600 file owned by quantt (stat only). A oneshot with RemainAfterExit is
     otherwise never re-run, so a changed --vault or rotated keys would leave
     the old keys in /run/quantt while the run reported success (release-check
     #2). It is done here, while no job can run, because the restart removes and
     re-creates /run/quantt;
  6. start every ENABLED timer, plus any that was running, or enable them all
     with `--enable`, then READ BACK that each is active, and refuse if one is
     not. The end state is set by enablement, not by what happened to be
     running. Otherwise a re-run after a refusal that had stopped the timers
     would exit 0 with all three still stopped (release-check #2).

Restarting DOES replay a slot missed while the timers were stopped. Measured
on the VM, 2026-10-08 [V]: an ENABLED Persistent=false timer, stopped and
restarted within one boot across a missed slot, fires at once on the restart.
(This corrects an earlier note in this file, which said restarting did not
replay; parser comment (b).) So an install that spans 15:52/15:55 (12:52/12:55
on an early close) would replay the send slot into a late, partial send. To
prevent that, the installer refuses at planning on a weekday inside 15:30-16:00
or 12:30-13:00 ET (PLAN_REFUSE_RANGES_ET, a superset of the runner's
LATE_LOCAL_RANGES). It refuses the timer restart inside 15:52-16:00 or
12:52-13:00 (RESTART_REFUSE_RANGES_ET, the send window to the close), and checks
the clock again before restarting the timers, leaving them stopped if it is
now inside a window. Other replays are harmless: a replayed :00/:30 session
idles outside its slots, a replayed collect is a collect, a replayed 17:30
verify writes the day's line, and a replayed 22:00 decide decides once
(DECIDED). Any failure after step 1, a refusal or an unexpected
exception, reads the timers back and reports any that are STOPPED: nothing
trades until the installer is re-run or the timers are started. Planning also
refuses a venv built from a requirements.txt other than the tag's
(REQUIREMENTS_RECORD, written by bootstrap.sh).

TIMEZONE: ONE MECHANISM
-----------------------
The timers' OnCalendar lines carry no zone, so systemd reads them as
system-local time. The installer refuses unless /etc/localtime names
America/New_York (bootstrap.sh sets it). There is no `--accept-timezone`: on a
VM the zone is ours to set, so nothing equivalent needs accepting. The runner's
own ET clock gates are the second guard.

SCHEDULE
--------
* `Persistent=false`: a firing missed while the VM was DOWN never runs at boot
  (systemd.timer(5)). Measured on the VM, 2026-10-08 04:43-04:56 UTC [V]: last
  run 04:44:00, then powered off; slots 04:46-04:54 passed while down; boot at
  04:55:07; next run at the regular 04:56:00. A stop and restart WITHIN one
  boot is different: it replays (see THE TIMERS ARE STOPPED FOR THE RUN).
* A firing that passes WHILE ITS SERVICE IS STILL RUNNING is not dropped.
  MEASURED on the VM, 2026-10-07 (Ubuntu 24.04.4, systemd 255.4-1ubuntu8.17): a
  transient timer firing every minute at :00 (AccuracySec=1s, Persistent=false)
  on a 90-second job started the next run the moment the previous one exited.
  The 23:14:00 firing ran at 23:14:30. For this book that means:
    - the 15:52 send polls its orders until each is final (`_poll_final`). That
      usually ends within seconds; in the worst case it runs to 30 s before the
      close (15:59:30 for a 16:00 close);
    - so the 15:55 firing usually lands INSIDE the window, while the send is
      still running or just after, and then idles on STARTED. In the worst case
      it starts after the window, where the date roll idles it;
    - either way the session must idle on STARTED and the Alpaca-clock send
      window.
  The runner's gates are the ONLY guard on that path, not a second one. The
  test that covers the idle is quantt/session/tests/test_run.py::
  test_late_scheduled_decides_once_then_sends_once. `DeferReactivation=`
  (systemd >= 256) would remove the late start, but Ubuntu 24.04 ships 255.
* `AccuracySec=1s`: systemd's default is 1min, and within that window "the
  expiry time will be placed at a host-specific, randomized" position
  (systemd.timer(5)). That would put a 15:52 firing anywhere up to 15:53.

THE KEY FILE
------------
`quantt-secret.service` (quantt.deploy.boot_secrets) writes /run/quantt/alpaca.env
at boot. The job units declare `Wants=` + `After=` on it, deliberately NOT
`Requires=`. systemd.unit(5): a unit with Requires= "will be stopped (or
restarted) if one of the other units is explicitly stopped (or restarted)".
Rotating the keys (`systemctl restart quantt-secret`) during the 15:52 window
would then kill a send mid-batch. A failed fetch would also stop verify from
starting at all, leaving that day with no verify.log line, and silence must
never read as success. With Wants=, a job whose key file is missing fails
loudly in its own log, and verify records FAIL.

"Once per boot" holds only when the fetch SUCCEEDS. A failed key service is
inactive, so every job start pulls it in again through Wants=. That makes it
self-healing (a role assignment made later starts working on the next firing).
The cost is delay: After= holds the job until the fetch ends, up to about 4
minutes per job start when every request times out. That is IMDS 6 x 10 s plus
82 s of backoff, about 142 s, then about 47 s per secret
(azure_keyvault.IMDS_DELAYS, KEYVAULT_DELAYS, TIMEOUT_S). A 4xx refusal ends
the fetch at once.

WHAT IT NEVER DOES
------------------
* Reads a credential. It knows the vault's NAME only.
* Runs anything quantt cannot already change, with one exception, accepted:
  it runs as root FROM the quantt-writable venv and clone. So quantt (or code
  running as quantt) can make root run code at the next install. The impact is
  low, because quantt already holds the keys and runs the book; the gap is
  noted in docs/RUNBOOK.md section 8.
* Imports quantt.session or any broker code.
* Writes a unit not named quantt-*.
* Writes AUTO_ARMED.

# -- what systemd runs (review 2026-10-07) -----------------------------------
#
# A unit FILE is not what systemd runs. A drop-in (`systemctl edit` writes
# <unit>.d/override.conf; `set-property` writes under system.control; a
# `quantt-.service.d/` directory applies to every quantt-* service) is merged on
# top of the file. A disarm-by-reinstall that rewrote only the file would leave
# an override's Environment=DRY_RUN=0 in force. So the installer asks systemd:
# before planning, that no drop-in exists and the unit comes from our file; after
# daemon-reload, that what systemd loaded is exactly what was written. This is
# install_prod's launchd precedent (refuse when the loaded job and the file could
# disagree), applied to systemd.
#
# The `systemctl show` formats parsed here (`Key=value` lines; ExecStart as
# `{ path=... ; argv[]=... ; ... }`; TimersCalendar as `{ OnCalendar=... ; ... }`)
# are systemd's [S]. A format this code cannot read REFUSES, never passes.
# MEASURED on the VM (systemd 255.4-1ubuntu8.17, 2026-10-07) [V]:
#   * `systemctl show quantt-nonexistent.service -p FragmentPath -p DropInPaths
#     -p Environment` exits 0 and reports all three, empty, with
#     LoadState=not-found. So a first install's planning reads empty values, and
#     no "unit not found" error.
#   * Environment= is reported in FILE order (file ZED, ALPHA, MID -> show
#     `ZED=1 ALPHA=2 MID=3`), so the ordered comparison below is exact, and
#     check_unit pins the order at planning.
#   * A drop-in written WITHOUT daemon-reload is INVISIBLE here. DropInPaths
#     stays empty, the old Environment is shown, and NeedDaemonReload stays
#     `no`, until the next reload, which would be this installer's own. So
#     `systemctl show` cannot be the pre-write check. `dormant_overrides`
#     scans the disk instead. (A naive probe on an inactive, unreferenced unit
#     looks fine, because systemd re-reads that from disk on query; the
#     measurement used a unit held loaded by an active timer.)
# MEASURED on the VM (systemd 255.4-1ubuntu8.17, 2026-10-08 ~01:10 UTC) [V]:
#   (a) A start queued behind its After= dependency (the dependency
#       `activating`) reads `systemctl is-active` = inactive, ActiveState=
#       inactive, SubState=dead. But `show -p Job` is a job id, and
#       `list-jobs` shows `<id> <unit> start waiting`. So `is-active` alone
#       misses a queued job; `job_states` reads ActiveState AND Job.
#   (b) CORRECTED 2026-10-08 (release-check #3). This note first said a
#       restart does NOT replay a missed slot. That came from a probe on a
#       started-but-NOT-ENABLED timer, which is likely unloaded on stop and
#       so forgets its last trigger. It does not apply to our enabled timers.
#       MEASURED on the VM [V: 2026-10-08 04:38-04:41 UTC; OnCalendar *:*:00
#       and *:*:30, enabled]: fired 04:39:00, stopped 04:39:00, slots
#       04:39:30 and 04:40:00 missed, `systemctl start` at 04:40:15 -> ran at
#       04:40:15, LastTriggerUSec=04:40:15. So an ENABLED Persistent=false
#       timer restarted within one boot across a missed slot fires AT ONCE.
#       That is why the installer refuses inside the late windows and
#       re-checks the clock before it restarts the timers (_refuse_if_late).

# `systemd-analyze unit-paths` lists them already [S]; they are added anyway,
