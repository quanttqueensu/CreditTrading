# Idea ledger

**One line per idea tested: date, idea, data, gross result, status.** It is a record, not a
gate (team lead, 2026-11-09, `docs/SYSTEM.md` §5; `docs/MISSION.md` §2). It stops an idea
being re-run blind and shows which families are working. Add the line **in the same commit**
as the test. A dead idea may be revived with a new angle: new data, a new mechanism, a
different horizon or a different instrument.

**Status words.** `IDEA` card written, not tested · `EXPLORE` gross test run, see the result ·
`PAPER` running on a paper account · `SHADOW` running as a simulated book on live data ·
`PROPOSED` go-live proposal with the team · `LIVE` · `SET ASIDE` no effect found, with what
would reopen it · `REVIVE?` a pre-2026-11-09 kill whose gross effect was positive and whose
gate (cost, factor exposure, the deflated bar) no longer applies.

**Figures are gross unless a cell says otherwise**, with the panel's last date where the
source gives it. Labels: `[V]` verified in the session that wrote the line, `[S]` copied from
the named source file, `[U]` unverified.

## Backfill: everything tested before 2026-11-09

Copied on 2026-11-09 from `docs/RESEARCH_STATE.md` at `3595ec8` (its KILLED, WATCH, ACTIVE
and CLOSED tables), so **every figure below is `[S: docs/RESEARCH_STATE.md]`** and none was
re-run. That file holds the full evidence and the reproducing command for each row. The
`then` column is the old verdict code (D1 no gross edge, D2 costs, D3 decayed, D4 factor
exposure, D6 conditional, D7 too few events). The last column re-reads each row under the
2026-11-09 rules: costs and factor exposure no longer end an idea, so a D2 or D4 row with a
positive gross effect is a candidate again. **That re-reading is the author's, not a result.**

### Trading on paper

| date | idea | data | gross result | then | status now |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-31 | CEF-DISC, the core: discount z-score reversion on 13 credit CEFs, no-trade band | CEF prices and NAVs | deployed-set IC −0.033 (t −1.68), 523 dates from 2013-06; factor alpha t 2.94 daily (fit to 2022-12-30) | ACTIVE | PAPER (core account) |
| 2026-10-14 | C4: the same z-score pooled over five more CEF families, 74 funds | family prices and NAVs | fit gross SR 1.217 (NW t 5.32); holdout 2023-01-03 → 2026-09-30 gross SR 1.434 on the corrected book | PASS, paper only | PAPER (C4 account) |
| 2026-11-03 | C4-LEVEL: C4's discount level against family peers, blended ½ : ½ by risk with its z | as C4 | holdout level-only gross SR 1.636; blend 14.56%/yr against z-only 10.32% | PASS, K3 overridden | PAPER (inside C4) |
| 2026-11-01 | VT: size each account at its equal-risk multiplier (core ×1.30, C4 ×1.26) | fit-period book returns | claims no Sharpe; judged on forward stops | APPROVED | PAPER (both accounts) |
| 2026-11-03 | TE4: on a thin session trade the 4–5 eligible names instead of flattening | core panel | +2.13pp/yr at matched turnover (t 2.34); 87% of it PIMCO; holdout t 0.72 | APPROVED, dark | built, key absent |

### Gross effect present, stopped by a gate that no longer applies

| date | idea | data | gross result | then | status now |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-14 | XASSET-X3: month-end Treasury extension, long IEF over the last 3 sessions | ETF daily, 2002–22 | SR 1.04, NW t 4.94; placebo passes; holdout SR 0.59 | D4 (TERM β 0.34) and D2 | REVIVE? a part-time term-premium sleeve; futures are the cheap instrument |
| 2026-10-14 | C5: fill the evening's CEF trade at the t+1 opening auction | CEF panel, opens, 2016–22 | +293bp/yr (SR 1.16, t 2.82); holdout +313.6bp/yr (SR 2.12, t 4.66) | D1 on the lagged placebo (+351bp/yr) | REVIVE? the placebo says the gain is session drift on the book's own trades, which is still a gain: an execution choice to test on paper |
| 2026-10-20 | NAV tenders: buy a CEF after its NAV tender is announced, tender, ETF-hedge | EDGAR, CRSP, 2010–22, 104 events | +1.08% per event (cluster t 2.80); sleeve gross SR 0.450 | D2, D4, bar | REVIVE? on total return; capacity binds (about half a day's volume at $1m) |
| 2026-10-27 | Ex-date drift: short a CEF at the ex-date close, cover at +3, peer-hedged | 17 credit CEFs; C4 families | CAR(+1..+3) −34.3bp (t −14.9) on C4's families, −20.5bp (t −6.8) on the credit 17, 2005–22 | approved, 2023+ test never opened | REVIVE? built and off; hundreds of events a year |
| 2026-10-29 | PCEF reconstitution: trade fund-of-CEF index changes | CRSP MF holdings | PCEF alone +184bp (t 5.5) then −120bp (t −5.6); placebo +8bp; pooled result an artifact from YYY | post-hoc subgroup; built, off | REVIVE? needs announcement dates |
| 2026-07-31 | pair-reversion: 22 within-class credit ETF pairs | ETF daily | combined gross SR +1.03, mean pairwise correlation +0.027 | D2 and leverage (vol 0.37%) | REVIVE? only where leverage is cheap (futures, portfolio margin) |

| 2026-10-20 | MA-HZ: merger arbitrage on the completion-hazard hump, long high-hazard weeks | CRSP deals 2001–22 | hump holds out of sample (hazard 0.069 vs 0.025) | WATCH, power | REVIVE? as a shadow book; broad, uncorrelated |
| 2026-07-30 | S3-forced-flow: fallen-angel forced selling and recovery, in the bonds | TRACE bond-day panel to 2025-12-04 | −424bp trough (t −17.5), 82–85% reversal | D6, fires in crises; no wrapper expression | REVIVE? regime-gated, ETF expression (ANGL/FALN) in stress only |
| 2026-07-30 | S3-wrapper: the same through ANGL/FALN against HYG | ETF daily | unconditional pair SR 0.37; alpha t 1.98 | D4 | REVIVE? a credit-quality premium sleeve |
| 2026-10-14 | XASSET-X4: multi-asset trend, 14 ETFs | ETF daily, to 2022-12 | SR 0.45, NW t 1.964; holdout 0.19 | D4, spanned by TSMOM | REVIVE? a trend sleeve needs futures breadth, not 14 ETFs |
| 2026-10-14 | XASSET-X1: credit and rates trend, 9 ETFs | ETF daily, 2008–22 | SR 0.41, NW t 1.62; holdout −0.39 | D1 | SET ASIDE inside X4 |
| 2026-07-30 | E1-band: HYG vs JNK premium/discount ±2σ band | ETF PD | SR 0.75 → 2.64 → 0.41 → 0.48 by era; return fell 2.54% → 0.05%/yr | WATCH: opportunities vanished | REVIVE? in wrappers not yet industrialised, and in stress |
| 2026-10-27 | BDC discount z-score | Compustat NAV, 54 BDCs | all BDCs IC +0.0258 (t 5.14); at ADV ≥ $3m the NAV term is t 0.48 beside 5-day reversal | nothing tradable | REVIVE? the tradable part is short-term reversal: test it as that, on a wide universe |
| 2026-10-20 | A2: insider open-market buying in BDCs | Form 4, 2006–22 | +100bp over 21 sessions (t 3.13); the sales placebo +91bp | closed: it is the post-report window | REVIVE? as a post-report drift, which is what it measured |
| 2026-10-19 | SSX-1 census: 57 event candidates screened, 8 pass a count gate | EDGAR, CRSP | no returns computed; passes: clustered insider buying (3,485 clusters 2010–22), PFF index additions, earnings-date delays (368 a year), fund issuance, 8-K red flags, S&P 400/600, downgrade flag | 8 pass, none tested | IDEA: the largest untested inventory on the desk |
| 2026-11-02 | Turn-of-month on the CEF book | CEF panel | not quoted in the ledger | WATCH | IDEA: test anchored on pay dates, on a wide universe |
