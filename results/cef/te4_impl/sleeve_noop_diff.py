"""The no-op proof for CEF trial 55's sleeve code (te4): the core sleeve, key absent, byte for byte.

WHY (CLAUDE.md, code rules: "a new frozen-spec key must default to current behaviour, and the
no-op must be proved by diffing sleeve output byte-for-byte with the key absent"; the
pre-registration results/cef/PREREG_THIN_TRADE_ELIGIBLE_2026-11-03.md §1.6). The te4 commits
add `below_min_names = "trade_eligible"`, `below_min_names_floor`, an `account` declaration on
the sleeve's constructor and a reduced branch in `target_positions`. None of it may move a single
byte of the core's targets while the spec does not set the key, and none of it may move them when
the key is written out as its default, "flatten".

WHAT IT DOES. Runs `CEFDiscountSleeve.target_positions` from TWO checkouts of this repository --
the code before te4 (`--base-tree`, a worktree at ac15d09) and the code under test (`--new-tree`,
default: the checkout this file is in) -- each in its own fresh interpreter, with:

  * the LIVE spec, read through that checkout's `scripts/cef/spec.py` (the two spec files must be
    byte-identical; checked), never edited: the variants below are copies in memory;
  * the SAME real panel for both: `data/cef/` of the new tree, read only (the sleeve's PX_PATH and
    NAV_PATH are pointed at it in each child, because a fresh worktree has no `data/`);
  * every decision date of the panel: every date on which the universe has a paired close and NAV
    above $0.50, the sleeve's own inner join (`_read_panel`), from the first to the last;
  * two books on each date: FLAT (holdings {}, `opening_session` False: the band trades from zero
    to the edge, the path a re-entry after a flat day takes) and HELD (a fixed share book, every
    universe name, alternating +700 / -500 shares, so the band's HOLD and TRADE branches, the
    dust filter and the gross ceiling all run); `sleeve_nav` = the spec's `capital_usd`.

Variants (a child each):
  base:absent     ac15d09's code, the live spec              -- the reference
  base:flatten    ac15d09's code, below_min_names "flatten"   -- the default written out, before
  new:absent      the new code, the live spec                 -- must equal base:absent
  new:flatten     the new code, below_min_names "flatten"     -- must equal base:absent
  new:te4         the new code, below_min_names "trade_eligible", floor (below), account "paper",
                  extras thin_rule {"stop": None}: on every date with at least `min_names`
                  eligible names its targets, with meta["cef_thin"] removed, must equal
                  base:absent (§1.6 item 2); the thin dates are counted, not compared, because
                  there the rule is meant to differ.

EVERY CHILD RUNS WITH PYTHONHASHSEED=0. The band iterates `set(w.index) | set(held_w)`, so the
order in which the banded book is summed for the gross ceiling follows the string hash seed, and
two runs of the SAME code under different seeds differ in the last bit of a capped weight.
Measured 2026-11-03 with this script's child on the last 150 decision dates (new:absent): seeds 1,
2 and 3 against seed 0 differed on 23, 24 and 20 of the 300 (date, book) lists, each by one or two
ulps in a weight (0.3115173064058714 against 0.31151730640587133). A fixed seed makes the children
comparable; it moves nothing but that summation order. (That the live sleeve is reproducible only
to the last bit across processes is a finding about today's code, reported, not changed here.)

Each target is reduced to (instrument, side, kind, qty, weight, reason, combo_id, meta items in
order), the list for one (date, book) is pickled (protocol 4), and the pickles are hashed: sha256
per (date, book), and sha256 of the concatenation in date order per variant. A raise on a date is
recorded as ("RAISE", type, message) and compared like a target list. The comparison is of those
bytes: equal hashes mean equal pickles, which mean equal floats bit for bit, equal reasons
character for character and equal meta.

THE FLOOR for new:te4 is read from the spec (`scripts/cef/spec.py`'s BELOW_MIN_NAMES_FLOOR) once
the key exists; until the activation commit sets it, the pre-registration's approved value, 4
(§1.1, derived there, not here), as `results/cef/prereg_thin_te4/compose.py` does. The output says
which.

    python3 results/cef/te4_impl/sleeve_noop_diff.py --base-tree <worktree at ac15d09>
    # five children in parallel, each about 21 minutes on every date (measured 2026-11-03:
    # 1,278-1,293 s per child, 7,018 dates); --dates last:200 for a quick look (about 30 s)

Writes `sleeve_noop_diff_output_<stamp>.txt` beside this file (never overwriting another stamp's
without --overwrite), and the per-variant pickles under --workdir (a temporary directory unless
given). Read only: it opens the panels and the spec, and writes nothing under data/ or ops/.
