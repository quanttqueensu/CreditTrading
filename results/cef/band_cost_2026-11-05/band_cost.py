"""The band width re-derived from the measured execution cost, and its plateau check (2026-11-05).

    python3 -B results/cef/band_cost_2026-11-05/band_cost.py \\
        --data-root <a checkout's data/ (read only)> --cut-dir <a new folder OUTSIDE the repository>
        -> results/cef/band_cost_2026-11-05/band_cost_2026-11-05.{json,txt}

    Before the first run in a fresh worktree: `python3 scripts/cef/c4_paper_benchmark.py stage`
    (copies C4's gitignored CRSP extract into results/cef/c4/_cache_c4/, sha-checked).

ZERO TRIALS; FIT ONLY. This is the analysis behind `results/cef/PREREG_DRAFT_BAND_COST_2026-11-05.md`,
a DRAFT pre-registration (CEF stays 55). It changes no spec and nothing on the live path. Every panel
is copied with a parquet filter at 2022-12-30 into --cut-dir before anything is computed, so no row of
the 2023+ holdout is ever materialised, and every frame that reaches a statistic is asserted to end
by 2022-12-30. Nothing under data/ is written; --cut-dir must be outside the repository.

WHY (team lead, 2026-11-05: "pre-register a re-derivation of the rebalancing band using the measured
execution cost"). The 4.8% band was derived on 2026-09-06 by the cube-root law

    h* = (3 c sigma_w^2 / (2 kappa_w))^(1/3)

at an ASSUMED cost of 15-22bp (`_band_width_note`). The paper book's cost has now been measured:
B = 7.14bp per unit of notional traded against the official close
(`results/cef/EXEC_COST_STUDY_2026-11-05.md`, PR #58, commit 2476a16, not yet merged). This script
puts that c into the same law with sigma_w and kappa_w re-measured on the fit, for both books, then
checks whether the derived width lands on the fit's plateau. It does not pick a width from the grid.

THE COST INPUTS ARE READ, NOT TYPED (H14). They come from the study's output of record,
`results/cef/exec_cost_2026-11-05/aggregates_2026-11-05.json`, read at --cost-ref (default the pinned
commit 2476a16 of branch exec-cost-study; once PR #58 merges the same path on main is identical):
  * core c  = tables["all (core, late_market)"]["B_bp"]                      (pooled, notional-weighted)
  * its 95% interval = B_day_mean +- t(20 df, 0.975) x B_day_mean / B_day_t, the study's own arithmetic
  * C4 c    = core c x the quoted-half-spread ratio at 15:52 (the send minute), C4's 15 traded names over
              the core's 13, mean over 21 sessions (spread_profile ... half_spread_bp_mean["15:52:00"]).
              C4's own fill cost is ONE session (the opening build) and is not used (decision C in the
              draft). The median ratio is printed beside it as a sensitivity.

THE DEFINITIONS, DECLARED HERE BEFORE THE COMMITTED RUN. A scratch prototype of the same code was run
first, on 2026-11-05. The target-dynamics definitions below are the prototype's, unchanged. ITS PLATEAU
POINT ESTIMATES (the net-Sharpe columns by width, both books) WERE SEEN BEFORE THE PLATEAU READING
BELOW WAS WRITTEN; the paired tests (P2) had not been computed. So P1's 0.05 tolerance is descriptive,
chosen with the point estimates in view, and decides nothing alone; P2 is the test.

  The book whose target is measured: the UNIT target T, before the band and the cap.
    core: `band_frontier.build_targets()` on the spec's 13 names (the harness book every core study uses);
    C4:   `c4_paper_benchmark.spec_targets` = CEF trial 54's blend, the v5 sleeve's construction
          (DG-L4 matched it to the sleeve on 907 of 907 sessions), on trial 52's frozen 74.
  WHY UNIT AND NOT x m. Both specs apply the band to held / m against the unit target
  (`_sizing_multiplier_note`: "The band compares the unit target with held/m"), so `band_width` is a
  UNIT-weight quantity. Under mean-variance the multiplier is a change of risk aversion: the target, the
  deviation penalty and the cost all scale with m, and the optimal band in unit weights does not move.
  The cube-root law with kappa_w standing in for the penalty is not scale-free (h ~ m^(2/3) in account
  weights, so m^(-1/3) in unit weights). The account-weight reading is printed beside the primary as a
  sensitivity, and the draft explains the choice. The original derivation was at m = 1, where the two agree.

  Active pairs (t-1, t): sessions on which the book trades on BOTH days.
    core: neither session thin (`band_frontier.thin_sessions`, the live flatten rule's mask);
    C4:   neither row a hold (C4's spec holds on thin sessions; a hold repeats the previous row exactly,
          which an active row never does, `band_frontier._check_thin_matches_T`'s contract).
  WHY. On a thin session the core is flat and the target does not diffuse; on the hold book it is
  frozen. Counting those sessions dilutes sigma_w^2 but not kappa_w measured on active pairs, which
  biases h* down. sigma_w and kappa_w are both measured on the same active pairs.

  Name-days: the name has a non-zero unit target on both t-1 and t (it is in the book on both days).
  WHY. The law's sigma_w is a diffusion. An entry (0 -> w) or an exit (w -> 0) is a jump, which the
  band meets as one trade to its edge. "Non-zero on either day" is printed as a sensitivity.

  sigma_w = the pooled sample sd of dT over those name-days (per day).
  phi_w   = the pooled AR(1) coefficient through the origin, sum(T_t T_{t-1}) / sum(T_{t-1}^2), over the
            same name-days; kappa_w = -ln(phi_w); half-life ln 2 / kappa_w.
  The per-name mean of the sd is printed as a sensitivity.

  CALIBRATION. The 2026-09-06 inputs (sigma_w 0.04083/day, phi_w 0.95280) were measured on the
  17-name v6 book over the whole sample to 2026-09, by a script that is in neither main nor tag
  pre-clean-slate (searched 2026-11-05). This script runs the same definitions on the 17 names over the
  FIT ONLY and prints them beside the original. It cannot reproduce the original's window.

THE PLATEAU CHECK (fit, the book each account trades):
    core: m x band_gross_capped(T, b, cap / m, below_min_names="flatten", thin=thin_sessions(T.index))
          (trial 53's implementation B, `results/cef/prereg_voltarget/flatten_exact.py`);
    C4:   m x band_gross_capped(T_B, b, cap / m)  (C4 holds on thin sessions inside T_B;
          `c4_paper_benchmark.h11_reference`'s construction).
  Scored by `scripts/research/harness.evaluate` (shift(2), nan_policy "raise"), on total return and on
  price-only return (paper pays no distributions: its P&L of record is price only). Gross is the
  headline; net at the cost the width was derived at, and the 5/15/30bp grid, sit beside it, labelled.
  Widths: the derived h* x 2^(k/3), k = -3..3 (each step is the width the law gives at double or half
  the cost), unioned with the frontier's own sweep points 1.6-9.6% and the live 4.8%.
  Reading, declared:
    (P1) point estimate: is net Sharpe at c* at h* within 0.05 of the grid's best?
    (P2) paired test: is the grid argmax's net Sharpe at c* above h*'s with a two-sided HAC p < 0.05
         (`scripts/research/resampling.sharpe_diff`, block 21, M 999, seed 20261105)? If not, h* is not
         distinguishable from the top of the grid.
    The slope direction (is the best width narrower or wider than h*) is reported for each era.
  H2: two widths of one band cannot be matched on turnover without becoming the same width. The pair
  (h*, live 4.8%) is reported as an H2 pair only if their turnovers are within 5%; otherwise the
  comparison is priced at c (net), and the draft says so.

NO SILENT FALLBACKS. A missing input raises naming it. No number about the market is typed here.
