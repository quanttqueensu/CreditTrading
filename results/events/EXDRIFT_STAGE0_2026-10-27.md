> **The answer, plainly.**
> - **D4 does not fail across the full fit. It passes:** alpha t 4.57 and every summed beta within
>   ±0.073 (MUNI −0.07, TERM −0.03).
> - **The large rate betas are mostly a 2021–22 feature**, at about −0.4 on both factors. A smaller
>   version appears in 2010–15 (−0.19 and −0.15). They are near zero in 2005–09 and 2016–20.
> - **But D4 fails in every era taken alone, on different grounds:**
>   - 2005–09 on alpha, where stage 1 also fails;
>   - 2010–15 and 2021–22 on MUNI and TERM;
>   - 2016–20 on HY (+0.21).
>
>   So a window the length of the test set (3.8 years) has failed D4 four times out of four on the
>   fit.
> - **Amendment 1**, run in-sample on the full window:
>   - it keeps D4 passing;
>   - it lowers alpha t to 3.97 and the deflated Sharpe to 0.93, so the verdict becomes NEITHER;
>   - it makes the cap bind on 18.5% of rows.
>
>   On the fit, then, it costs more than it buys.
> - All of this is descriptive: the fit was seen before the pre-registration was written (§0.1).
>
> ---
>
> **2026-10-28, late: amendment 1 and O1–O4.** The team lead ruled three things:
> - amend part (b) before the opening, to hedge each event's MUNI and TERM exposure with MUB and IEF
>   at frozen fit betas;
> - accept O1–O4, with the P&L window ending **2026-10-09**;
> - drop the ETF refresh.
>
> **Amendment 1** is recorded in the pre-registration with its provenance, its frozen betas and the
> gross cost.
> - Its re-rehearsal on fit 2021–22 still gives **KILL D4**: alpha t 2.59; MUNI −0.37 and TERM −0.39
>   at target.
> - The hedge lifts the sized gross to 2.44, so the cap binds on 41.6% of rows.
>
> **O1–O4** are recorded in `exdrift_open_rulings.csv` (team lead, 2026-10-28). The GO row is empty.
>
> **At the 2026-10-09 window** every event's e+3 still falls inside: the last event is 2026-10-01,
> with e+3 on 2026-10-06. So the set stays **649 events (548 on the 13)**, with T = 946 sessions.
> - Per-event P(t ≥ 2) is 0.91 (17) and 0.86 (13) at the fit effect, and 0.38 and 0.33 at half.
> - The sleeve's P(`_dsr` pass, N = 7) is 0.43 and 0.03; Sharpe needed 1.871.
>
> **What remains before `open`:**
> 1. The team lead's `run_exdrift_r2.sh`; then Stage 0 is re-run and its pins committed.
> 2. French's 202610 vintage, which must cover through 2026-10-09.
> 3. The GO row.
> 4. The team lead's decision on amendment 1, given that it does not cure D4 on the fit.

> **2026-10-28, evening: Nuveen recovered via CRSP; R10 re-ruled KEEP; `open` written, reviewed and rehearsed on

>
> **The rulings** (team lead, 2026-10-28, answered interactively):
> 1. **"Nuveen declarations: recover via CRSP"**, from `dsedist.dclrdt`, 2023-01-01 → 2024-12-31.
> 2. **R10: basket funds with no declaration found are KEPT.** This is a stated limitation, named in
>    the opening's report: "the hedge basket's exclusion window uses ex-dates that may not have been
>    public at decide time".
> 3. **"The opening stage: write it, have it reviewed, then the team lead decides."** Rehearse it on
>    fit data only, recompute the power, and do not run `open`.
>
> **CRSP recovery** (`scripts/events/fetch_exdrift_crsp_decl.py`).
> - The team lead's live pull is `pull`, run through `run_exdrift_r2.sh`. Until it lands, the rows
>   are staged offline (`stage --from`) from an extract of the same tables already on this machine:
>   research-ss-expansion's `dsedist`, pulled 2026-10-19T19:58Z. That makes the recovery
>   provisional.
> - **86 not-found events are recovered** (84 Nuveen, 2 BlackRock), all declared by e−1.
> - Their record dates equal Alpaca v1's on all 86, so no `X2_crsp_record_mismatch` flag.
> - As a second source, CRSP's `dclrdt` equals the sponsor release date on 319 of the 324 events
>   where both exist, differs by one day on 1, and is more than a day later on 4.
> - **100 Nuveen events remain excluded**: 2025–26, which CRSP's mirror does not reach.
>
> **The eligible set, as ruled** (X4 filled, R10 KEEP): **649 events** (548 on the 13) on 152 dates
> in 46 months. Beside: 631 with the no-declaration legs excluded, and 635 with X4 not filled.
> Stage 0 stays **CLEAR**: 757 flags, all ruled, R10 superseded.
>
> **The opening** is `scripts/events/exdrift_open.py`, with the gate `exdrift_trial.open_gate`.
> - It implements §4.5, §4.6, §9.1, §5.4 and §6 as written.
> - An independent quant review (2026-10-28) found 3 blockers and 7 should-fixes, all fixed:
>   - a factor gap or an unmeasurable control is now a HALT, not a kill;
>   - R-D4's betas are scaled to the vol target (NAV-tender precedent, O2);
>   - the inputs are pinned by sha256 in the Stage-0 record, and the opening's eligible count must
>     equal Stage 0's before any statistic;
>   - `load_test` needs the gate's token, and OPENED is created exclusively and checked in every
>     branch's history;
>   - the trial code must be committed;
>   - the R10 alternative is reported beside;
>   - stage 3 compares like with like (O3);
>   - the declaration date is asserted at every leg;
>   - the X4 basis check is C4's adjacent-bar check (O4).
> - **The gate refuses unless every one of these holds:**
>   - Stage 0 is CLEAR and committed;
>   - k is committed;
>   - French, IEF, HYG and MUB cover the P&L window and its lag row (O1: T = 950 sessions, to
>     2026-10-15);
>   - the pins match;
>   - the code is clean;
>   - O1–O4 and a GO row are ruled by the team lead in `exdrift_open_rulings.csv` (blank today);
>   - `--team-lead-go` equals the GO row's date.

>
> **What remains before `open`:**
> 1. The team lead runs `! bash .claude/worktrees/exdrift-stage0/run_exdrift_r2.sh`: the live CRSP
>    pull, and Alpaca's bars around the 24 X4 cells for O4. An agent then re-runs Stage 0, which
>    re-pins the inputs, and commits.
> 2. French's daily factors must cover through 2026-10-15; they end 2026-09-30.
> 3. **IEF and HYG in `data/etf_daily.parquet` end 2026-10-09.** Under O1 they too must cover through

> | DG-X1 | **FLAGGED** (32) | Every one of the 769 yfinance ex-dates from 2023-01-01 to the frozen end is on Alpaca, and Alpaca has none that yfinance lacks. 737 amounts agree within $0.001 (254 exactly). **The 32 that do not are all BIT, 2023-01-12 → 2025-08-15**, every ex-date before BIT's 2025-08-19 split record: yfinance 0.1205 against Alpaca 0.1237, after which they agree. The cause is [U] (a restated yfinance history is the likely one) |
> | DG-X2 | **FAIL** | **Alpaca's announcement `declaration_date` is not a declaration date.** PIMCO's own release, dated "NEW YORK, NY, October 1, 2025", declares the distributions with ex-date 2025-10-14 for PCN, PTY, PHK, PFN, PDI and PDO. Alpaca gives 2025-10-12, a Sunday, for all six. Over all 785 announcements the field sits 1–3 weekdays before the record date (2 weekdays on 688), and after it on 6: it is derived from the record date. **On that field 32 events would be "declared late" and excluded.** That count is printed and not flagged, because the field is invalid.

| **DG-X1** distributions | **AWAITING TEAM LEAD** | **The refresh is done, outside `data/`** (§2). 4,616 rows for the 17, last ex-date 2026-10-15 (the price panel's last session). On the overlap with `data/cef/cef_distributions.parquet` every ex-date and amount is identical (3,831 fit rows, 752 from 2023 on). It adds 33 ex-dates, 2026-09-11 → 2026-10-15. Every ex-date is a session. **The second source is not read yet**: CRSP needs a credential and its ret − retx is a return; `fetch_sponsor_notices.py` covers none of the 17; CEFConnect blocked the scripted request (reading R2) | the team lead's run (§5); then every 2023+ ex-date and amount is compared with Alpaca's (`X1_*` flags) |
| **DG-X2** declarations | **AWAITING TEAM LEAD** | No tracked panel holds a declaration date. Alpaca's deprecated `/v2/corporate_actions/announcements` carries one; whether it still answers is [U] | the same run. **If the endpoint refuses every window, DG-X2 FAILS** and the team lead rules on another declaration source |
| **DG-X3** record dates | **AWAITING TEAM LEAD** | Alpaca's `/v1/corporate-actions` carries the record date; the regime arithmetic of §4.2 (T+2: record = the session after ex; T+1 from 2024-05-28: record = ex) is coded and tested | the same run |
| **DG-X4** bars | **FLAGGED** (25) | **24 `X4_no_bar`:** the event fund has no close on its own ex-date e, on 2026-02-12 (PCN, PDI, PDO, PFN, PHK, PTY), 2026-02-13 (BIT, HYT, JFR, NAD, NEA, NVG, NZF), 2026-02-18 and 2026-03-18 (DSL), and 2026-09-15 (BIT, HYT, JFR, MHD, MQY, NAD, NEA, NVG, NZF). **These 24 cells are every missing close in the 17's 2023+ panel, and every one is on the fund's own ex-date** (each row is present with volume 0 and no close). **1 `X4_split`:** BIT 2025-08-19, factor 1.029. The split-basis guard classes it `undecidable` from the factor alone (\|ln k\| = 0.029 ≤ 2τ = 0.280), so it cannot raise there; rule 3 masks BIT's returns within ±5 sessions (R1), which removes one event. The spike-and-revert guard finds **0** hits and **0** unreverted jumps in the test window. No zero-volume fill day has a close. The panel's sessions equal `ops/schedule/nyse_calendar.py`'s | a ruling per flag. The same run fetches Alpaca's raw SIP bar on each `X4_no_bar` cell, so "fill from a second source" (C4's precedent, 2026-10-14) can be ruled without another run |
| **DG-X5** NAV | **FLAGGED** (552) | NAV is present on e..e+3 for every event (0 `X5_nav_missing`). **552 `X5_nav_repeat`** on the event fund's rows e+1..e+3: 552 of 2,304 cells (0.240). On the same rows in the fit: 1,758 of 9,600 (0.183); by fit era 0.170 / 0.165 / 0.212 / 0.179. By test year 0.223 / 0.263 / 0.243 / 0.225 (2023–26). Basket funds' rows, counted not flagged: 0.240. **The test rate is above every fit era's.** `docs/DATA.md` (correction of 2026-10-12) records Yahoo serving a NAV dated D that carries D−1's value | a class ruling (reading R6). A stale NAV moves the NAV leg towards zero, which is towards PASSING stage 3, so it biases the test for the trade |
| **DG-X6** factors | **FLAGGED** (1) | Test window for the factors: 2023-01-13 → 2026-10-06 (935 sessions, the first event's first return row to the last event's e+3). **French FF5 + UMD** (vintage 202609, fetched 2026-10-27) end 2026-09-30: **4 sessions uncovered**, 2026-10-01 → 10-06. IEF and HYG in `data/etf_daily.parquet` cover it (to 2026-10-09). **MUB:** absent from `etf_daily`; the new fetcher (`scripts/events/fetch_exdrift_mub.py`, yfinance) covers every session, as do its IEF and HYG copies. Source note: `docs/REFERENCES.md` §12az | a ruling on the 4 French sessions (reading R8) |
| **DG-X7** identity | **IDENTITY PASS; k PENDING** | §3. r6 and H-E's dispersion reproduce on the fit. k and the cap-binding share are fit P&L, which this run's brief forbade (R9) | `fit-k`, after the rulings |
| **DG-X8** numexpr | **PASS** | `compute.use_numexpr` is off at import. `numexpr_fault.run()` here: numexpr 2.10.1 returns wrong cells with the option on; the numpy path is clean. The denormal assertion runs on the identity gate's per-event series | — |

## 2. DG-X1: the refresh, and the change to the live-path fetcher

`scripts/fetch_cef_distributions.py` could only write `data/cef/` and fetched every
`cef_universe.csv` name, the 27 sealed ones among them. It is on the live path: the nightly
collector runs it bare. So it gained two options, **both off by default**:

- `--out DIR` writes only the actions panels, and only to DIR. A DIR inside `data/` is refused.
  The features and facts sections are skipped, because both write into `data/cef/`.
- `--tickers A,B,...` fetches only those names, each of which must be in `cef_universe.csv`. It is
  refused without `--out`, because the live panels are replaced whole.

**The no-op is proved byte for byte.** `results/events/exdrift/noop_fetch_cef_distributions.py`
runs the file as it stood at `66ec3df` (taken from git) and the edited file, each in its own
temporary tree, on one fake yfinance with the clock frozen. All seven files and all 17 printed
lines are identical: PASS. The tests pin the default outputs and the refusals. They fail against
the old file, which has no `main` and ignores every argument.

The refresh: `python3 scripts/fetch_cef_distributions.py --out
results/events/exdrift/_cache_exdrift/dist_refresh_2026-10-27 --tickers <the 17>`, run
2026-10-27 20:56 UTC. It is gitignored.

## 3. DG-X7: the identity gate (fit 2005-01-01 → 2022-12-30 only)

| figure | reproduced | published | tolerance | |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| r6 events (the 17, 2005–22) | 3,226 | 3,226 | exact | PASS |
| r6 CAR(+1..+3) | −20.4542bp | −20.454bp | 0.001 | PASS |
| r6 month-clustered t | −6.7655 | −6.765 | 0.001 | PASS |
| H-E per-event sd | 150.280bp | 150.3bp | 0.05 | PASS |

Printed beside it, not gated: 216 months; H-E 3,226 events with a fund return, 3,009 traded,
6.7% with a basket of fewer than 3, median basket 12; sd of monthly means 41.45bp (published
41.4). **The refreshed panel's fit rows are identical to `data/`'s, so the gate holds on the panel
the trial will use.** The fit was read through parquet filters at 2022-12-30. The table is
`exdrift_fit_descriptive_2026-10-27.csv`. No H-E mean was computed.

## 4. The test set, re-measured (dates only; H14: these counts decide nothing)

| | events | on the 13 | dates | months | H-E ≥ 3 (calendar) | on the 13 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| pre-registration §5.1 | 752 | 575 | 169 | 45 | 714 | 537 |
| `data/` panel, re-counted | 751 | 574 | 169 | 45 | 713 | 536 |
| **refreshed panel, to the frozen end** | **768** | **587** | **173** | **46** | **729** | **548** |

- **The one-event difference is rule 3**, under reading R1: a BIT event whose hold rows lie
  within 5 sessions of BIT's 2025-08-19 split record. No event is excluded by rule 2.
- **The test set's end is frozen at ex-date 2026-10-12** (R7). That is the earlier of the refreshed
  panel's last ex-date (2026-10-15) and the session 3 before the price panel's last (2026-10-15).
  The last event in the set has e = 2026-10-01.
- By year: 205 / 205 / 204 / 154 (2023–26). T+2: 290; T+1: 478.
- The basket column here needs a bar on e..e+3 and no split-masked row, and it uses every known
  ex-date. The declared-at-e−1 calendar waits on DG-X2.

**The block.**
- `fit-k` calls `require_stage0_rulings_only`. That runs `data_guards.require_stage0_rulings` on
  the committed flag table and the rulings file.
- `open` also calls `require_stage0_clear`. It needs the committed record to say `CLEAR` and a
  committed k.
- Both refuse, naming what is missing. Both are stubs that raise after the block. They are
  written and reviewed once Stage 0 clears.

## 5. What the team lead runs, and what needs a ruling

**One credentialed run** (read-only GETs on the cef paper key; it prints no key). From the main
checkout's root:

```
! bash .claude/worktrees/exdrift-stage0/run_exdrift_ca.sh
```

- The wrapper sits at the worktree root and is excluded from git (`info/exclude`). It sets
  `QUANTT_ENV_FILE` to `config/.env` and runs `fetch_exdrift_corp_actions.py --bars-for
  <the flag table>`.
- It makes about 295 GETs, paced at 0.35s, so it takes about 2 minutes:
  - Alpaca `/v1/corporate-actions` for the 17 from 2023-01-01;
  - the announcements endpoint, per symbol, in windows of at most 90 days;
  - raw SIP bars on the 24 `X4_no_bar` cells.
- Its output goes to the gitignored `_cache_exdrift/`. An agent then re-runs `stage0` offline.
  That adds the `X1_*`, `X2_*` and `X3_*` flags and rewrites the still-blank rulings form.

**Rulings** (each flag has a `recommended` column in the flag table):

| flags | recommended |
|---|---|
| 24 `X4_no_bar` | fill the close from Alpaca's raw SIP bar where it has one (C4, 2026-10-14); otherwise exclude the event and count it. Never fill with zero (rule 4) |
| `X4_split` BIT 2025-08-19 (1.029) | confirm it is not a change to the close's share basis. Rule 3 already keeps it out of every event and basket |
| 552 `X5_nav_repeat` | the test rate is above every fit era's. Before a class ruling, check the flagged cells against a second NAV source (CEFConnect, as the stale-NAV gate does), and rule each stale copy "excluded from the NAV leg, counted" |
| `X6_FF6_uncovered` | wait for French's 202610 vintage and run R-D4 on the whole window (recommended), or run it on the covered sessions and print the 4 |
| R1–R9 | the implementation readings, in `READINGS` of `exdrift_trial.py` and in the flag table. R9 asks for a go on `fit-k` |
| `X1_*`, `X2_*`, `X3_*` | after the run |

**Outside this trial, for the team lead's information.**
- **The 24 missing closes sit exactly on ex-dates** (`docs/REFERENCES.md` §12az). That points to a
  defect in how the daily price fetch handles an ex-date in 2026. The cause is [U]. *Updated
  2026-10-28:* they are yfinance's rows for an "out-of-range" dividend (NaN OHLC, volume 0), kept by
  `scripts/cef/fetch_daily.py`, the live path. See the rulings proposal's last section.
- The panel read here is this checkout's `data/`, through 2026-10-15. Whether prod's panel on the
  VM has the same gaps was not checked.
- `python3 -m ops.doc_audit --check` reports one DRIFT that predates this branch: `docs/SYSTEM.md`
  points to `results/events/_cache_r7_r2_pull/`, which this checkout does not hold. It was
  present at `66ec3df`.

## 6. Inputs and their provenance (no credential was read)

| input | source | label |
|---|---|---|
| prices, NAVs, distributions to 2026-10-15 | this checkout's `data/` (a symlink to the main tree), read-only | [V] dates |
| refreshed distributions | §2, yfinance, 2026-10-27 | [V] |
| French FF5 + UMD | `scripts/data/fetch_ff_factors.py`, 2026-10-27, vintage 202609 | [V] |
| MUB, IEF, HYG (yfinance) | `scripts/events/fetch_exdrift_mub.py --symbols MUB,IEF,HYG`, 2026-10-27T21:02:49Z | [V] dates |
| IEF, HYG | `data/etf_daily.parquet`, dates only | [V] dates |
| Alpaca corporate actions and bars | not yet fetched (§5) | — |

**Trial accounting.**
- EVENTS stays at 3, and CEF at 52. `docs/RESEARCH_STATE.md` is not changed by this run.
- The 2023-01-01 time holdout is not opened.
- The 27 names are not consumed.
