# Evidence log

**The dated record a research report on this desk will be written from.** One entry per result,
ruling, release, incident or live-P&L day, from the desk's first commits (tag `pre-clean-slate`)
to today. What the pack is and the report skeleton the `supports:` field points at:
`results/report/README.md`. The format is checked by `scripts/report/evidence_log.py`; the
reproducer for the pack's figures is `python3 -m scripts.report.build_pack`.

**How it is appended to.**
- **Append-only.** A new entry goes at the end, in the same commit as the change it records
  (`CLAUDE.md`, research rules; `.claude/rules/report.md`). Live days are appended by
  `python3 -m scripts.report.snapshot_live` (ids `E-<date>-90` for the core, `-91` for C4).
- **Corrections are dated, never silent edits.** An existing entry is never changed or deleted.
  A correction is a new entry (`kind: correction`) giving the old and the new figure and what it
  supersedes. `build_pack.py` and `snapshot_live.py` refuse a log whose existing entries changed.
- **The backfill of 2026-11-03** (everything before the first live-day entry) was copied from
  the named files by the pack's agents, file by file, and is in date order; later entries are in
  the order they were appended.

**Tags on every figure.**
- `[S]` copied verbatim from the named committed file, not re-run by the pack (the default);
- `[V]` the named file itself labels the figure verified or re-run, or `build_pack.py` re-derived it
  from committed data;
- `[U]` the source labels it uncertain, or two sources disagree. Then both figures are given, each
  tagged `[U]`, and the entry says which is the record (`docs/SYSTEM.md` §0, order of authority).

**Eras.** `HISTORY` is everything before the 2026-09-28 clean slate, read from tag
`pre-clean-slate` (f6d155f) or `ibkr-final` (db795a9): **provenance, never evidence of what is
true now** (`CLAUDE.md`). Where a later correction superseded a HISTORY figure, both are shown,
dated. `ALPACA` is 2026-09-28 onward.

**Sources.** `path @ commit` is the file the figures were copied from and its last commit on
`main` (or the tag's commit). A branch file not yet on `main` says so. A live day cites the VM
pull it came from (`pull:<sha12>`, recorded in `data/live/<book>/pulls.csv`), because the commit
that adds it does not exist when it is written.

  - the 2026-11-04 plan bought 520 IGR (about $5,876, 5.9% of NAV) on z=−0.79, mostly the artifact; the other 14 orders were clean (no other price row moved beyond 0.5%; one SCD NAV row 0.7%) [V]
  - checklist step 5 (a step, not a spike, means STOP): the team lead ruled "Hold C4 one day, fix IGR". `ops/HALT_c4.md` was written in the prod clone at 23:47 ET; the runner's `halts_for` reads it for c4 and nothing for cef [V]
